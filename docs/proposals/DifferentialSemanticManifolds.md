# Research Proposal: Differential Semantic Manifolds: A Trajectory-Based Framework for Dynamic Concept Representation

## Abstract

This research proposes a novel approach to semantic representation through the development of **Differential Semantic Manifolds (DSM)** - a mathematical framework that models concepts not as static points in a vector space but as dynamic trajectories on non-Euclidean manifolds with position-dependent metrics. Inspired by the philosophical work of Gilles Deleuze and differential geometry, DSM addresses fundamental limitations in current embedding technologies: their static nature, context-insensitivity, and inability to capture qualitative transformations in meaning. We formalize a trajectory-based representation system using Riemannian geometry, develop position-dependent metric learning techniques, and implement evaluation methods aligned with dynamic concept evolution. Our framework extends beyond standard approaches by enabling the modeling of conceptual drift, asymmetric relations, and intensive differences that traditional Euclidean embeddings cannot represent. This research bridges theoretical computer science, differential geometry, and philosophy of language to create semantically richer representations with applications in natural language processing, knowledge representation, and computational creativity.

## 1. Introduction

### 1.1 The Problem of Static Representation

Current semantic representation technologies rely predominantly on Euclidean vector spaces where concepts occupy fixed positions and relationships are measured through uniform distance metrics. While powerful, these approaches fundamentally constrain our ability to model language and knowledge in three significant ways:

1. **Static Representation**: Words and concepts are treated as having fixed identities in embedding space, contradicting the dynamic, context-dependent nature of meaning.

2. **Homogeneous Space**: Distance metrics remain constant across the entire space, applying the same rules of comparison regardless of conceptual domain or context.

3. **Identity-Based Relations**: Relations between concepts are modeled through their positions rather than through their transformative processes, limiting our ability to represent how concepts evolve through interaction.

These limitations have practical consequences: embeddings struggle with polysemy, context-sensitivity, and conceptual evolution over time. While contextual embeddings (e.g., BERT) partially address these issues, they still fundamentally represent each context as a distinct point in a static space rather than as a dynamic process.

### 1.2 A New Approach: Differential Semantics

We propose a fundamentally different approach to semantic representation drawing inspiration from differential geometry and the philosophical insights of Gilles Deleuze, whose work on "difference" and "becoming" provides a theoretical framework for understanding concepts as dynamic processes rather than static entities. This approach:

1. Replaces fixed vector representations with trajectories in non-Euclidean space
2. Implements position-dependent metrics that vary across conceptual domains
3. Models relationships as transformative processes rather than distances
4. Captures qualitative (intensive) differences rather than merely quantitative (extensive) ones

## 2. Background and Related Work

### 2.1 Current Embedding Technologies

Semantic embeddings have evolved substantially from early models like Word2Vec and GloVe to contextual embeddings like BERT and more recent approaches like sentence transformers. Each advancement has increased representational power but maintained certain fundamental limitations:

| Approach | Characteristics | Limitations |
|----------|----------------|-------------|
| Word2Vec/GloVe | Static word vectors in Euclidean space | One vector per word; no context sensitivity |
| BERT/Transformer Embeddings | Contextual representations | Still represents each context as a fixed point |
| Hyperbolic Embeddings | Non-Euclidean geometry for hierarchical concepts | Better for taxonomies but static representation |
| Graph Neural Networks | Relational structure between concepts | Relations are typically predefined and fixed |

### 2.2 Non-Euclidean Representations in Machine Learning

Non-Euclidean geometries have demonstrated value in machine learning contexts where Euclidean assumptions prove limiting:

1. **Hyperbolic Spaces**: Provide exponential capacity for representing hierarchical structures [Nickel & Kiela, 2017]
2. **Manifold Learning**: Techniques like UMAP and t-SNE that project high-dimensional data onto lower-dimensional manifolds
3. **Information Geometry**: Statistical manifolds where probability distributions form a Riemannian manifold

### 2.3 Philosophical Foundations: Deleuze's Differential Thinking

Gilles Deleuze (1925-1995) was a French philosopher whose work in "Difference and Repetition" (1968) and other texts developed a philosophy centered on difference rather than identity, becoming rather than being. Key concepts relevant to our computational framework include:

1. **Difference in Itself**: Deleuze inverts the traditional philosophical prioritization of identity over difference. Rather than seeing difference as a comparison between identities, he positions difference as primary and identity as an effect of difference.

2. **Intensive vs. Extensive Differences**: Extensive differences (like size) can be divided without changing their nature. Intensive differences (like temperature or pressure) change qualitatively when divided.

3. **Multiplicities**: Structures defined by relations between differences rather than by identity or essence.

4. **Becoming vs. Being**: Emphasis on processes of transformation rather than fixed states.

Deleuze was deeply interested in differential calculus and Riemannian geometry, seeing them as mathematical expressions of his philosophical concepts. His work provides a theoretical framework for rethinking how we represent meaning in computational systems.

## 3. Differential Semantic Manifolds: Technical Framework

We propose a technical framework called Differential Semantic Manifolds (DSM) that implements these insights through the following components:

### 3.1 Mathematical Foundations

#### 3.1.1 Riemannian Manifolds for Semantic Representation

DSM represents the semantic space as a Riemannian manifold (M,g) where:
- M is a smooth manifold representing the space of possible meaning states
- g is a position-dependent metric tensor that varies across the manifold

This allows us to define distance between semantic points x and y as:

$$d(x,y) = \min_{\gamma \in \Gamma_{xy}} \int_{0}^{1} \sqrt{g_{\gamma(t)}(\dot{\gamma}(t), \dot{\gamma}(t))} dt$$

Where:
- $\Gamma_{xy}$ is the set of all paths from x to y
- $\gamma(t)$ is a path with $\gamma(0) = x$ and $\gamma(1) = y$
- $\dot{\gamma}(t)$ is the tangent vector to the path at t
- $g_{\gamma(t)}$ is the metric tensor at position $\gamma(t)$

#### 3.1.2 Concept Representation as Trajectories

Rather than representing a concept as a point, we represent it as a trajectory through the manifold:

$$C = \{\gamma_C(t) | t \in [0,T]\}$$

Where $\gamma_C(t)$ represents the evolution of concept C over parameter t. This captures:
- The dynamic nature of concepts
- Their context-dependent variation
- Their transformative potential

#### 3.1.3 Vector Fields for Concept Relations

Relations between concepts are modeled as vector fields that transform one concept trajectory into another:

$$R(C_1) = C_2 \iff \exists \phi_R: \gamma_{C_1}(t) \mapsto \gamma_{C_2}(t)$$

Where $\phi_R$ is a mapping determined by the vector field associated with relation R.

### 3.2 Implementation Architecture

We propose three progressive implementation strategies:

#### 3.2.1 Enhanced Metric Learning

The most immediately implementable approach enhances standard embeddings with learned position-dependent metrics:

```python
class LearnedMetricModel:
    def __init__(self, base_embedding_model):
        self.base_embeddings = base_embedding_model
        self.metric_network = MetricNN()  # Neural network outputting metric tensors
        
    def embed(self, text):
        return self.base_embeddings.embed(text)
        
    def distance(self, embedding1, embedding2):
        midpoint = (embedding1 + embedding2)/2
        metric_tensor = self.metric_network(midpoint)
        diff = embedding2 - embedding1
        return torch.sqrt(diff @ metric_tensor @ diff)
```

This approach maintains computational efficiency while introducing position-dependent comparisons.

#### 3.2.2 Normalizing Flows for Manifold Warping

A more sophisticated approach uses normalizing flows to transform standard embeddings into manifold coordinates:

```python
class ManifoldFlow:
    def __init__(self, base_embedding_model):
        self.base_embeddings = base_embedding_model
        self.flows = [InvertibleNN() for _ in range(LAYERS)]
        
    def embed(self, text):
        # Get base embedding
        x = self.base_embeddings.embed(text)
        
        # Transform through flows to manifold coordinates
        for flow in self.flows:
            x = flow.forward(x)
            
        return x
        
    def compute_metric_tensor(self, point):
        # Compute Jacobian of the inverse transformation
        J = self.compute_inverse_jacobian(point)
        
        # Metric tensor is J^T J
        return J.T @ J
```

This allows us to learn a warping of Euclidean space that respects semantic relationships.

#### 3.2.3 Neural ODEs for Trajectory Generation

The most complete implementation uses Neural Ordinary Differential Equations to model concept trajectories directly:

```python
class TrajectoryModel:
    def __init__(self):
        self.encoder = TextEncoder()  # Encodes text to initial state
        self.dynamics = NeuralODE()   # Models trajectory evolution
        
    def embed(self, text, time_horizon=1.0):
        # Get initial state
        initial_state = self.encoder(text)
        
        # Generate trajectory through manifold
        trajectory = self.dynamics.solve(initial_state, time_horizon)
        
        return trajectory
        
    def similarity(self, traj1, traj2):
        # Compute trajectory alignment with phase considerations
        return trajectory_alignment(traj1, traj2)
```

### 3.3 Learning Approaches

We propose three types of learning for this framework:

1. **Manifold Structure Learning**: Learning the topology, metric tensor field, and curvature of the semantic manifold from text corpora.

2. **Vector Field Learning**: Learning transformative mappings that represent semantic relationships (e.g., analogy, entailment, causation) as operations that transport concept trajectories.

3. **Intensity Learning**: Learning to identify thresholds where quantitative changes in embedding coordinates correspond to qualitative changes in meaning.

## 4. Experimental Evaluation Plan

### 4.1 Evaluation Challenges

Traditional evaluation metrics for embeddings (e.g., word similarity, analogy tasks) are insufficient for assessing our framework since they assume static representations. We propose novel evaluation approaches:

### 4.2 Proposed Evaluation Metrics

1. **Contextual Polysemy Resolution**: Measure the model's ability to track semantic shifts across different contexts compared to static embeddings.

2. **Semantic Phase Transition Detection**: Assess the model's ability to identify points where meanings undergo qualitative shifts.

3. **Translation Path Evaluation**: Evaluate whether the paths between translated terms capture intermediate semantic states.

4. **Conceptual Drift Tracking**: Evaluate the model's ability to track how concepts change meaning over time in a corpus.

5. **Asymmetric Relationship Accuracy**: Test the model's ability to represent relationships where similarity is not symmetric.

### 4.3 Datasets

1. **WiC (Words in Context)**: For evaluating polysemy handling
2. **Metaphor Detection Datasets**: For evaluating qualitative semantic shifts
3. **Historical Corpora**: For conceptual drift over time
4. **Specialized Domain Corpora**: For testing domain-specific semantic transitions

## 5. Expected Contributions and Applications

### 5.1 Technical Contributions

1. A mathematical framework for representing concepts as trajectories in non-Euclidean spaces
2. Novel algorithms for learning position-dependent metrics from text data
3. Techniques for identifying semantic phase transitions
4. New evaluation methodologies for dynamic semantic representations

### 5.2 Potential Applications

1. **Enhanced Semantic Search**: Better handling of context-dependent queries and conceptual relationships
2. **Knowledge Graph Enrichment**: Representing complex, non-hierarchical relationships between concepts
3. **Conceptual Blending Systems**: Computational creativity applications that combine concepts in novel ways
4. **Drift Detection**: Tools for tracking how concepts evolve in scientific literature or social media

## 6. Related Work

### 6.1 Manifold Learning in NLP

Recent work has begun exploring manifold structures for language representation. [Poincaré embeddings](https://arxiv.org/abs/1705.08039) (Nickel & Kiela, 2017) and [hyperbolic neural networks](https://arxiv.org/abs/1805.09112) (Ganea et al., 2018) use hyperbolic spaces for hierarchical representation. Our work extends this direction by incorporating dynamic trajectories and position-dependent metrics.

### 6.2 Dynamic Embeddings

[Dynamic word embeddings](https://arxiv.org/abs/1702.08359) (Bamler & Mandt, 2017) and [temporal embeddings](https://arxiv.org/abs/1907.05321) (Rosin et al., 2019) have focused on tracking semantic change over time. Our approach generalizes this to arbitrary contextual evolution, not just temporal.

### 6.3 Neural ODEs

[Neural Ordinary Differential Equations](https://arxiv.org/abs/1806.07366) (Chen et al., 2018) introduced a framework for modeling continuous transformations that inspired our trajectory-based approach. We extend this work specifically to semantic representation.

## 8. Conclusion
