# Philosophical Knowledge Graph & Semantic Search Platform

## Vision Document

### Executive Summary

We propose to build **PhiloGraph** - a specialized knowledge platform that combines semantic search capabilities with relationship modeling for philosophical texts. The system will serve both individual researchers through a CLI and larger audiences via an MCP interface and web platform. Beginning with a focused MCP server providing immediate utility for essay writing and research, the platform will strategically expand to fulfill the complete vision. This document outlines the high-level vision, architecture, key design considerations, and strategic implementation roadmap.

## 1. Core Vision

PhiloGraph will be a comprehensive tool for philosophical research that:

1. **Connects ideas across texts** through explicit relationship modeling and semantic similarity
2. **Organizes knowledge flexibly** - supporting both traditional hierarchical structures and non-hierarchical exploration
3. **Enables sophisticated queries** combining semantic search with relationship traversal
4. **Supports research workflows** from discovery to writing and citation
5. **Functions across multiple interfaces** (CLI, MCP, web) to serve different user needs
6. **Delivers immediate utility** with a focused initial implementation

**Non-Hierarchical Exploration:**
- Support for texts that break from traditional organization (e.g., Deleuze & Guattari's "1000 Plateaus")
- Visualization tools for alternative relationship structures
- Capability to reorganize and view content through different organizational lenses

**Conceptual Relationships:**
- **defines/is_defined_by**: Track where concepts are formally defined vs. used
- **contradicts/is_contradicted_by**: Opposing philosophical positions
- **extends/is_extended_by**: One text building on another's concepts
- **critiques/is_critiqued_by**: Critical engagement with ideas

**Historical Relationships:**
- **precedes/follows**: Temporal relationships in intellectual history
- **responds_to/is_responded_to_by**: Direct philosophical responses
- **influenced/is_influenced_by**: Intellectual heritage relationships

**School/Tradition Relationships:**
- **belongs_to_school**: Associate text with philosophical traditions
- **revises/is_revised_by**: Updates to philosophical positions within traditions
- **canonical/non-canonical**: Status within a philosophical tradition

**Methodological Relationships:**
- **applies_method_of**: Shared philosophical approaches
- **introduces_methodology**: Novel philosophical methods

**Dialog Relationships:**
- **in_dialog_with**: Texts engaged in implicit conversation
- **synthesizes**: Texts that combine multiple perspectives

**Thematic Relationships:**
- **explores_theme**: Connect texts by philosophical themes
- **central_to/peripheral_to**: Relevance to specific philosophical debates

### 5.5 Inference Capabilities

PhiloGraph's inference module will support:

1. **Transitive Relationship Inference**
   - If text A influences text B, and B influences C, infer A indirectly influences C
   - Implemented using recursive Common Table Expressions (CTEs)

2. **Inverse Relationship Maintenance**
   - Automatically create bidirectional relationships (if A cites B, then B is_cited_by A)
   - Implemented via database triggers or application logic

3. **Path Discovery**
   - Find chains of influence between distant texts
   - Example: "Show the intellectual pathway from Kant to Derrida on the concept of 'truth'"

4. **Conceptual Inheritance**
   - If text A defines a concept and text B extends A, infer B inherits that concept
   - Useful for building concept genealogies

5. **Contextual Clustering**
   - Infer relationships between texts that share multiple connections to the same texts
   - "These texts likely belong together because they cite similar sources"

6. **Semantic Relationship Validation**
   - Verify explicit relationships by measuring semantic similarity
   - Example: If text A supposedly "extends" text B, their embeddings should have meaningful similarity

7. **Relationship Discovery**
   - Suggest potential relationships between semantically similar texts that lack explicit connections
   - "These texts have 90% semantic similarity but no recorded relationship - consider adding one"

8. **Conceptual Drift Analysis**
   - Track how concepts evolve through intellectual history by comparing embeddings along relationship chains
   - "How did 'truth' semantically shift from Kant to Hegel to Marx?"

9. **Cross-School Concept Mapping**
   - Identify semantically similar discussions across different philosophical traditions
   - "Show Continental philosophy texts that discuss concepts semantically similar to Wittgenstein's 'language games'"

10. **Weighted Path Discovery**
    - Enhance relationship paths by incorporating semantic relevance scores
    - "Show the path from Kant to Derrida, prioritizing texts with high semantic similarity to 'deconstruction'"

### 5.6 Essay Support Features

PhiloGraph will provide specialized support for the essay writing process:

1. **Evidence Collection**
   - Find supporting quotations for specific arguments
