# Philosophical Knowledge Graph & Semantic Search Platform

## Vision Document

### Executive Summary

We propose to build **PhiloGraph** - a specialized knowledge platform that combines semantic search capabilities with relationship modeling for philosophical texts. The system will serve both individual researchers through a CLI and larger audiences via an MCP interface and web platform. Beginning with a focused MCP server providing immediate utility for essay writing and research, built upon an extensible core, the platform will strategically expand to fulfill the complete vision. This document outlines the high-level vision, architecture, key design considerations, and strategic implementation roadmap.

## 1. Core Vision

PhiloGraph will be a comprehensive tool for philosophical research that:

1.  **Connects ideas across texts** through explicit relationship modeling and semantic similarity
2.  **Organizes knowledge flexibly** - supporting both traditional hierarchical structures and non-hierarchical exploration
3.  **Enables sophisticated queries** combining semantic search with relationship traversal
4.  **Supports research workflows** from discovery to writing and citation
5.  **Functions across multiple interfaces** (CLI, MCP, web) to serve different user needs
6.  **Delivers immediate utility** with a focused initial implementation built for expandability

## 5. Design Decisions & Considerations

### 5.1 Hosting Model

**Options:**

1.  **Fully Local**: CLI-only version that runs entirely on user's machine
2.  **Hybrid**: Local CLI with optional cloud sync for sharing/backup
3.  **Fully Hosted**: Web-based service with subscription model

**Considerations:**
- Local option provides privacy and control but limits community features
- Hosting costs scale with data size and user count
- Text-only storage is relatively inexpensive compared to image/video

**Recommendation:**
Start with a hybrid approach - local CLI with optional account linking for synchronization and sharing. This provides immediate utility while allowing for growth.

### 5.2 Community Features

**Potential Features:**
- Shared collections (e.g., course reading lists)
- Collaborative annotation
- Relationship suggestion/verification
- Citation sharing
- **Philosophy Social Network Integration:** Explore potential integration with or development of a dedicated platform (similar concept to GROK/X) allowing users to share insights, debate, and reference their PhiloGraph libraries within a social context. Requires careful consideration of privacy, data ownership, and community moderation. (Future Phase)

**Privacy/Sharing Model:**
- Private by default
- Explicit sharing of specific collections
- Optional public profiles for academics/enthusiasts

### 5.3 Processing Pipeline

    Chunker --> Embedder[Embedding Generator]
    Embedder --> Indexer[Database Indexer]
    Indexer --> RelExt[Relationship Extractor]
    RelExt --> Final[Final Storage]
```

**File Format Support & Processing Notes:**
- **Input:** Accepts individual files or entire folders for bulk processing.
- **Formats:** Plain text, Markdown, EPUB (priority). PDF, HTML (future). Transcripts (future).
- **Metadata & Structure:** Extracts standard metadata, chapter/section structure, and footnotes/endnotes. Links notes to originating text elements.
- **Citation Handling:** Attempts to extract page numbers from PDFs. For EPUBs or PDFs lacking page numbers, relies on structural identifiers (chapter/section/paragraph) for citation pointers. A mapping strategy will be developed for correlating EPUB structure to available PDF page numbers when both formats exist for a source.
- **Error Handling:** Includes validation checks for extracted metadata and prompts user for corrections if needed.

### 5.4 Local File Management

**Strategy:** Maintain a user-configurable local directory mirroring the structure of the ingested library.

**Purpose:**
- Provide users direct access to their original source files.
- Allow easy opening of source documents for context verification (potentially opening to specific location if supported).
- Serve as a potential backup or alternative access point.

**Organization:**
- Files organized logically (e.g., by author, title, or user-defined structure).
- Metadata stored in the database will link text elements back to the specific file path and potentially location (page/section) within the local file.
- The system will not *require* this local structure to function but will offer it as a complementary feature. Synchronization between the database and local file structure will be managed carefully.

### 5.5 Relationship System

PhiloGraph will support a rich relationship model including:

**Hierarchical Relationships:**
- **is_contained_in/contains**: Book → Parts → Chapters → Sections → Subsections → Chunks

**Non-Hierarchical Exploration:**
- Support for texts that break from traditional organization (e.g., Deleuze & Guattari's "1000 Plateaus")
- Visualization tools for alternative relationship structures
- Capability to reorganize and view content through different organizational lenses

**Conceptual Relationships:**
- **defines/is_defined_by**: Track where concepts are formally defined vs. used
- **contradicts/is_contradicted_by**: Opposing philosophical positions
- **extends/is_extended_by**: One text building on another's concepts
- **critiques/is_critiqued_by**: Critical engagement with ideas

**Historical Relationships:**
- **precedes/follows**: Temporal relationships in intellectual history
- **responds_to/is_responded_to_by**: Direct philosophical responses
- **influenced/is_influenced_by**: Intellectual heritage relationships

**School/Tradition Relationships:**
- **belongs_to_school**: Associate text with philosophical traditions
- **revises/is_revised_by**: Updates to philosophical positions within traditions
- **canonical/non-canonical**: Status within a philosophical tradition

**Methodological Relationships:**
- **applies_method_of**: Shared philosophical approaches
- **introduces_methodology**: Novel philosophical methods

**Dialog Relationships:**
- **in_dialog_with**: Texts engaged in implicit conversation
- **synthesizes**: Texts that combine multiple perspectives

**Thematic Relationships:**
- **explores_theme**: Connect texts by philosophical themes
- **central_to/peripheral_to**: Relevance to specific philosophical debates

### 5.6 Inference Capabilities

PhiloGraph's inference module will support:

1.  **Transitive Relationship Inference**
    - If text A influences text B, and B influences C, infer A indirectly influences C
    - Implemented using recursive Common Table Expressions (CTEs) or graph algorithms

2.  **Inverse Relationship Maintenance**
    - Automatically create bidirectional relationships (if A cites B, then B is_cited_by A)
    - Implemented via database triggers or application logic

3.  **Path Discovery**
    - Find chains of influence between distant texts
    - Example: "Show the intellectual pathway from Kant to Derrida on the concept of 'truth'"

4.  **Conceptual Inheritance**
    - If text A defines a concept and text B extends A, infer B inherits that concept
    - Useful for building concept genealogies

5.  **Contextual Clustering**
    - Infer relationships between texts that share multiple connections to the same texts
    - "These texts likely belong together because they cite similar sources"

6.  **Semantic Relationship Validation**
    - Verify explicit relationships by measuring semantic similarity
    - Example: If text A supposedly "extends" text B, their embeddings should have meaningful similarity

7.  **Relationship Discovery**
    - Suggest potential relationships between semantically similar texts that lack explicit connections
    - "These texts have 90% semantic similarity but no recorded relationship - consider adding one"

8.  **Conceptual Drift Analysis**
    - Track how concepts evolve through intellectual history by comparing embeddings along relationship chains
    - "How did 'truth' semantically shift from Kant to Hegel to Marx?"

9.  **Cross-School Concept Mapping**
    - Identify semantically similar discussions across different philosophical traditions
    - "Show Continental philosophy texts that discuss concepts semantically similar to Wittgenstein's 'language games'"

10. **Weighted Path Discovery**
    - Enhance relationship paths by incorporating semantic relevance scores
    - "Show the path from Kant to Derrida, prioritizing texts with high semantic similarity to 'deconstruction'"

### 5.7 Essay Support Features

PhiloGraph will provide specialized support for the essay writing process:

1.  **Evidence Collection**
    - Find supporting quotations for specific arguments
    - Identify contradicting viewpoints to address
    - Suggest relevant passages missed in initial research

2.  **Argument Construction**
    - Generate essay outlines based on collected evidence
    - Map logical relationships between chosen quotations
    - Identify gaps in argumentation

3.  **Citation Management**
    - Generate properly formatted citations for selected passages (using extracted page/structural info)
    - Track citation frequency and distribution across sources
    - Ensure balanced representation of required readings

4.  **AI-Assisted Drafting**
    - Collaborate with AI tools (like Gemini 2.5 Pro) via MCP interface to develop drafts incorporating cited materials
    - Check essay drafts against source material for accuracy
    - Get suggestions for further reading based on essay direction

3.  **Academic Pricing**: Discounted for educational institutions
4.  **API Usage**: Charge for MCP/API access based on usage

## 6. Strategic Roadmap & Funding Considerations

### 6.1 Strategic Approach: Immediate Utility First

PhiloGraph's development strategy prioritizes immediate utility while building toward the complete vision:

**Phase 0: MCP Server MVP & Core Foundation (1-2 months)**
- **Foundation First:** Implement a robust and extensible core data model (relational schema + vector store integration) designed for future relationship types and metadata (See 6.2).
- **MCP Essentials:** Deliver a minimal viable MCP server interface focused on immediate essay writing utility:
  - Core semantic search capabilities.
  - Basic citation generation support (addressing PDF/EPUB nuances).
  - Context filtering (e.g., by course, time period).
- **Pluggable Pipeline:** Build the initial text processing pipeline with pluggable components (chunking, metadata extraction) even if only one implementation is initially provided.
- **Target Users:** Aim at coding-capable users who can integrate with AI assistants (e.g., Claude) via the MCP API.
- **Demonstrate Value:** Focus on practical use cases in real academic contexts to prove immediate utility.

This approach provides:
- Immediate tangible benefits for research and writing
- A foundation to test key assumptions about semantic processing
- An entry point for early adopters and feedback
- A working system to demonstrate to potential funding sources

### 6.2 Technical Implementation for Expandability

To ensure the system can grow organically and adapt to future requirements, the initial development (**starting in Phase 0/1**) will focus on establishing robust extension points and a modular architecture using the following principles:

1.  **API-First Development:**
    - Define stable internal APIs between all core components (Text Processor, Search, Relationships, etc.).
    - Version all APIs from the beginning (e.g., `/api/v1/...`) to manage changes gracefully.
    - Utilize interface segregation principles to ensure clean, focused boundaries between components.

2.  **Plugin Architecture:**
    - Implement relationship types as plugins, allowing new types to be added without modifying core code.
    - Design the Inference Module using a rules engine pattern or similar strategy to allow new inference logic plugins.
    - Make embedding models pluggable, allowing users or administrators to switch or add models (e.g., OpenAI, Gemini, local Sentence Transformers).
    - Design the Text Processor's chunking system and metadata extraction with pluggable algorithms/strategies.

3.  **Database Versioning & Schema Design:**
    - Implement database schema migrations from the start (e.g., using Alembic for PostgreSQL).
    - Design the relational schema (metadata, relationships) for backward compatibility where possible.
    - Utilize flexible structures (like JSONB columns in PostgreSQL) for extensible metadata to avoid frequent table alterations.

4.  **Component Separation:**
    - Strictly isolate vector database operations (embedding storage, similarity search) from relationship logic (graph traversal, explicit links).
    - Separate text processing/ingestion pipelines from search and retrieval functionality.
    - Decouple user-facing interfaces (CLI, MCP, Web UI) from core backend services via the API layer.

### 6.3 Advanced Expandability Techniques

Further enhancing modularity and future adaptability:

1.  **Event-Driven Architecture (Consider for later phases):**
    - Implement an internal message bus (e.g., RabbitMQ, Kafka, or simpler in-process pub/sub) for asynchronous communication between components.
    - Use events for notifications (e.g., "document_processed", "relationship_added") to decouple services. Future components can subscribe to relevant events without requiring changes to existing ones.

2.  **Feature Flag System:**
    - Integrate a feature flag system (e.g., Unleash, Flagsmith, or custom implementation) early in development.
    - Allows for gradual rollout of new features, A/B testing, and disabling problematic components without redeployment.

3.  **Testing Strategy for Extensions:**
    - Design test suites specifically verifying the plugin interfaces and extension points.
    - Create a framework for testing relationship plugins and inference rules independently.
    - Implement integration tests that validate component independence and API contracts.

## 8. Key Questions for Dialogue

1.  **Scale Expectations**: How many texts do you anticipate in your personal collection vs. a potential community system?
2.  **Research Workflow**: What specific parts of your research/writing process need the most support?
3.  **Community Features**: Which social/community aspects would provide the most value?
4.  **AI Integration**: Beyond basic MCP search, what specialized capabilities would AI agents need?
5.  **Monetization Comfort**: Which revenue models align with your philosophy for this service?

## 9. Technical Considerations

### 9.1 Embedding Model Selection
- OpenAI's text-embedding-3-small (most capable but API cost)
- Gemini embeddings (with rate limits)
- Open-source alternatives (BERT, Sentence Transformers) - Pluggable via architecture.
- Domain-specific fine-tuning for philosophical texts (Future possibility).

### 9.2 Scalability Concerns
- Vector databases scale differently than traditional databases.
- Relationship queries can become expensive with large datasets (Requires optimization).
- Index optimization becomes critical at scale.

Options include developing a Calibre plugin or potentially forking Calibre to embed PhiloGraph features directly for a unified library management experience. Requires careful assessment of feasibility and maintenance overhead.
- **Quercus API:** Research the availability and capabilities of a Quercus (or similar LMS) API to potentially automate the downloading and processing of assigned course readings directly into PhiloGraph.
- **Reference Managers:** Standard import/export compatibility (e.g., BibTeX, RIS) with tools like Zotero, Mendeley. Explore deeper integration possibilities if APIs are available.
- **LMS:** Broader Learning Management System integrations for embedding PhiloGraph search or reading features within course pages.

### 9.4 Privacy and Ethics
- Attribution for shared content.
- Proper citation tracking and generation.
- Opt-in for any data usage beyond user's direct benefit.
- Clear policies regarding data ownership, especially in hosted/community versions.
