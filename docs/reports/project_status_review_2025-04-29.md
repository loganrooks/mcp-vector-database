# Project Status Review: PhiloGraph Tier 0 MVP (2025-04-29)

## 1. Overall Progress towards Tier 0 MVP

Significant progress has been made towards the Tier 0 MVP goals as defined in `docs/project-specifications.md` v2.3 and `docs/architecture/tier0_mvp_architecture.md`. The core components, including the database (PostgreSQL+pgvector), backend API (FastAPI), CLI (Typer), ingestion pipeline, search service, text acquisition service (via `zlibrary-mcp`), and LiteLLM proxy middleware, have been implemented.

The architecture aligns with the plan, utilizing Docker for local deployment (ADR 001) and leveraging cloud embeddings (Vertex AI via LiteLLM proxy - ADR 004) accessed through the LiteLLM gateway. The text acquisition workflow integrating the external `zlibrary-mcp` server is defined and partially implemented (ADR 008).

Extensive Test-Driven Development (TDD) cycles have been conducted across various modules (`config`, `utils`, `db_layer`, `ingestion`, `api`, `cli`), as evidenced by the test file structure (`tests/`) and Memory Bank logs. Recent debugging efforts have addressed critical API errors, particularly around `/ingest` and `/search` endpoints, and Docker/configuration issues.

**Current Status:** The foundational implementation is largely complete, but **full functionality is blocked** by invalid GCP credentials required for the LiteLLM proxy's connection to Vertex AI embeddings. Comprehensive testing and integration verification are pending resolution of this blocker.

## 2. Implemented Features/Modules (Mapped to Tier 0 Scope)

*   **Storage:** PostgreSQL + pgvector database schema defined and interaction layer (`db_layer.py`) implemented with async support and connection pooling.
*   **Middleware:** LiteLLM Proxy integrated into `docker-compose.yml` and utilized by `ingestion/pipeline.py` and `search/service.py` for embedding generation via Vertex AI.
*   **Backend API (`api/main.py`):** FastAPI application providing core endpoints:
    *   `/ingest`: Triggers ingestion pipeline.
    *   `/search`: Performs vector search with filtering via `search/service.py`.
    *   `/documents/{id}`: Retrieves document details.
    *   `/collections` (POST, GET /{id}, POST /{id}/items): Basic collection management.
    *   `/acquire`, `/acquire/confirm/{id}`, `/acquire/status/{id}`: Manages the text acquisition workflow via `acquisition/service.py`.
*   **Ingestion Pipeline (`ingestion/pipeline.py`):** Orchestrates document processing: path resolution, duplicate checks, extraction dispatch (`extract_content_and_metadata`), chunking (`text_processing.chunk_text_semantically`), embedding generation (`get_embeddings_in_batches` via LiteLLM), and DB indexing (`db_layer.add_document`, `add_section`, `add_chunks_batch`, basic `add_reference`). Handles directory processing.
*   **Search Service (`search/service.py`):** Generates query embeddings (`get_query_embedding` via LiteLLM) and executes filtered vector searches (`db_layer.vector_search_chunks`). Formats results.
*   **Acquisition Service (`acquisition/service.py`):** Implements the multi-step acquisition workflow, calling the external `zlibrary-mcp` server (via simulated `mcp_utils`) for search and download/RAG processing, and triggering the internal ingestion pipeline. Uses in-memory state tracking.
*   **CLI (`cli/main.py`):** Typer-based interface providing user access to `ingest`, `search`, `show`, `collection` management, and the `acquire` workflow (search by title/author, confirmation). Uses `httpx` to interact with the backend API.
*   **MCP Server (`mcp/main.py`):** Defines MCP tools (`philograph_ingest`, `philograph_search`, `philograph_acquire_missing`) mirroring CLI/API functionality, designed to call the backend API. (Note: Uses a simulated MCP framework).
*   **Configuration (`config.py`):** Centralized loading from environment variables and `.env` file.
*   **Utilities (`utils/`):** Modules implemented for file operations, async HTTP client, text processing (partially implemented/placeholders), and MCP interaction (simulated).
*   **Testing (`tests/`):** Pytest structure in place with numerous tests covering utils, config, db_layer, ingestion, API, and CLI, reflecting TDD process.

## 3. Identified Deviations (Implementation vs. Plan)

*   **Acquisition CLI Command:** The `acquire` CLI command currently searches based on `--title`/`--author`, whereas the pseudocode also mentioned a threshold-based finding mechanism (explicitly noted as not implemented in CLI). This seems like a practical simplification for Tier 0 user interaction.
*   **Acquisition Service State:** The service uses an in-memory dictionary (`acquisition_requests`) for tracking acquisition state. This is explicitly noted as a Tier 0 limitation in the pseudocode and implementation comments; a persistent DB-based solution would be needed for robustness beyond MVP.
*   **MCP Server Implementation:** The current `mcp/main.py` uses a simulated/mock MCP framework. A real implementation using an appropriate MCP library is required for actual agent interaction.
*   **Async/Sync Mismatch:** The simulated MCP server uses synchronous HTTP calls (`call_backend_api_sync`), while the backend API it calls is async. This needs alignment when implementing the real MCP server.
*   **Relationship/Bibliography Implementation:** While DB tables and basic API endpoints exist, the core logic for parsing citations (`ingestion/pipeline.py` calls `text_processing.parse_references`) and meaningfully linking/using them appears minimal, aligning with the deferred status of advanced features in Tier 0 specs. Basic storage seems present, but utilization is limited.
*   **Text Processing Utilities:** Functions like `call_grobid_extractor`, `parse_references`, `call_anystyle_parser` within `utils/text_processing.py` likely require further implementation beyond basic calls or placeholders to fully integrate with external tools (GROBID, AnyStyle).

## 4. Remaining Work / Next Steps for Tier 0 MVP

1.  **Blocker Resolution:**
    *   **Fix GCP Credentials:** Obtain and correctly configure valid GCP service account credentials for the LiteLLM Proxy to connect to Vertex AI. This is critical to unblock `/search` functionality and full testing. [Ref: Debug Early Return 2025-04-29 13:41:15]
2.  **Testing & Verification:**
    *   **Resume TDD:** Complete the interrupted TDD cycles, particularly verifying recent API bug fixes.
    *   **Integration Testing:** Perform end-to-end tests covering:
        *   Ingestion -> Search flow.
        *   CLI -> API -> Service -> DB interactions.
        *   Acquisition flow (CLI/MCP -> API -> Acquisition Service -> `zlibrary-mcp` [mocked] -> Ingestion Service -> DB).
    *   **Embedding Dimension Validation:** Conduct empirical tests (as outlined in ADR 004) to confirm the optimal embedding dimension (768 vs. 1024) for `text-embedding-large-exp-03-07` within Tier 0 resource constraints.
3.  **Implementation Completion/Refinement:**
    *   **Real MCP Server:** Replace `mcp/main.py` simulation with an actual MCP server implementation using a suitable library (e.g., `@modelcontextprotocol/server-nodejs` or Python equivalent), ensuring async compatibility with the backend API.
    *   **Text Processing Utilities:** Fully implement `call_grobid_extractor`, `parse_references`, `call_anystyle_parser` in `utils/text_processing.py` to integrate with the actual GROBID/AnyStyle tools/services.
    *   **Acquisition Service:**
        *   Consider adding basic DB persistence for `acquisition_requests` state for improved robustness even within Tier 0.
        *   Verify/refine path handling for files processed by `zlibrary-mcp` before ingestion.
    *   **Relationship/Bibliography:** Implement basic storage of parsed citation details (`db_layer.add_reference`) within the ingestion pipeline. Implement the basic citation formatting API endpoint.
4.  **Documentation:**
    *   Update `README.md` with comprehensive setup instructions (Docker, Python env, `.env` config, GCP setup for LiteLLM, `zlibrary-mcp` setup).
    *   Add basic usage instructions for CLI commands.
    *   Ensure adequate docstrings and inline comments in the code.
