## Abstract
 In recent years, the ideas of the mathematician Bernhard Riemann
 (1826-66) have come to the fore as one of Deleuze's principal sources
 of inspiration in regard to his engagements with mathematics, and
 the history of mathematics. Nevertheless, some relevant aspects and
 implications of Deleuze's philosophical reception and appropriation of
 Riemann's thought remain unexplored. In the first part of the paper
 I will begin by reconsidering the first explicit mention of Riemann
 in Deleuze's work, namely, in the second chapter of Bergsonism
 (1966). In this context, as I intend to show first, Deleuze's synthesis
 of some key features of the Riemannian theory of multiplicities (manifolds)
 is entirely dependent, both textually and conceptually, on his reading
 of another prominent figure in the history of
 mathematics: Hermann Weyl (1885-1955). This aspect has been largely
 underestimated, if not entirely neglected. However, as I attempt to
 bring out in the second part of the paper, reframing the understanding
 of Deleuze's philosophical engagement with Riemann's mathematics
 through the Riemann-Weyl conjunction can allow us to disclose some
 unexplored aspects of Deleuze's further elaboration of his theory of
 multiplicities (rhizomatic multiplicities, smooth spaces) and profound
 confrontation with contemporary science (fibre bundle topology and
 gauge field theory). This finally permits delineation of a correlation
 between Deleuze's plane of immanence and the contemporary physico-mathematical
 space of fundamental interactions.

 Bernhard Riemann (1826-66) constitutes one of the main figures of
 Deleuze's engagement with mathematics. 'The conjunction of Riemann's
 mathematics and Deleuze's philosophy', Arkady Plotnitsky writes, 'is a
 remarkable event in the history of twentieth-century philosophy, and
 it has major implications for our understanding of the relationships
 between mathematics and Deleuze's thought, and between mathematics
 and philosophy in general' (Plotnitsky 2009: 190). However, this
 understanding still remains largely unexplored, beginning with the
 relationship between Riemann and Deleuze itself.[^1]
 As is well known, Deleuze's first reference to Riemann is found
 in the second Chapter of Bergsonism (1966). The underlying issue
 lies in Bergson's distinction between (quantitative and qualitative)
 multiplicities, and the attempt to overcome the classical dichotomy
 between the One and the Multiple by affirming a substantive
 multiplicity. On the background of this philosophical problem, Deleuze
 synthesises, in a particularly dense passage, one of the key aspects of
 Riemann's theory of 'multiplicities' (manifolds):
 In fact, this problem dates back to a scholar of genius, Riemann, a
 physicist and mathematician. Riemann defined as 'multiplicities' those things
 (les choses) that could be determined in terms of their dimensions or their
 independent variables. He distinguished between discrete multiplicities and
 continuous multiplicities. The former contain the principle of their own
 metric ( portaient le principe de leur métrique) (the measure of one of their
 parts being given by the number of elements they contain) (la mesure d'une
 de leurs parties étant donnée par le nombre des éléments qu'elles contenaient).
 The latter found a metrical principle in something else, even if only in
 phenomena unfolding in them or in the forces acting in them (ne fût-ce que
 dans les phénomènes se déroulant en elles ou dans les forces agissant en elles).
 (Deleuze 1988: 39/31-2)[^2]
 To this passage Deleuze adds a very important footnote. First, he
 refers to Riemann's famous Habilitation lecture 'On the Hypotheses
 Which Lie at the Foundation of Geometry', dating to 1854 (but
 only published posthumously in 1868). As is known, it is in this
 lecture that Riemann first introduces the concept of manifold or
 manifoldness (Mannigfaltigkeit). Second, he refers to one of the major
 works of mathematical physics of the early twentieth century: Space,
 Time, Matter (1918), by the German mathematician Hermann Weyl
 (1885-1955). Weyl's book constitutes the first detailed exposition
 of Albert Einstein's general theory of relativity; as well as, starting
 in subsequent editions -on which the French translation adopted by
 Deleuze is based -Weyl's original elaboration of the first unified field
 theory.[^3] Finally, Deleuze suggests that even Husserl, although differently
 than Bergson, was influenced by Riemann's theory.
 Now, while the philosophical importance of Riemann for Bergson
 and Husserl will be frequently repeated in Deleuze's works, except for
 a passing mention (which we will encounter), Deleuze never referred
 to Weyl again. Thus, in most research appealing to the significance
 of Riemann for Deleuze's own theory of multiplicities, the relevance
 of Weyl has been largely overshadowed (except for Plotnitsky, who
 indicated this relevance), if not entirely neglected. Nevertheless, as I
 would like to show, reframing the reconstruction and understanding of
 the relationship between Deleuze and Riemann on the Riemann-Weyl
 conjunction allows us not only to reconsider the entire Deleuzian
 reception of Riemann's figure and work, but also to extrapolate some
 new aspects and implications of Deleuze's commitment with Riemann
 in his late works.
In the first part of the paper (sections I-III), I propose a detailed
analysis of the passage in *Bergsonism*, firstly to establish its strict
dependence on the explanation of Riemannian manifolds and space
theory found in Weyl's *Space, Time, Matter*. In the second part (sections
 IV-VII), I examine how Deleuze's further theory of multiplicities - within his
 attempt to overcome Leibniz's closed monadological universe towards
 an open nomadological 'chaosmos'- implies an intimate confrontation
 with important twentieth-century evolvements of Riemannian geometry,
 which can be precisely retraced in Weyl's work and subsequent
 developments, such as fibre bundle topology and gauge field theory.
 Finally, these developments allow us to highlight how Deleuze's ultimate
 philosophical elaboration of Riemann's thought finds a profound
 correlation between the concept of 'plane of immanence' and the
 physico-mathematical space of fundamental interactions described by
 contemporary science.
## I. Riemann between Mathematics and Physics
 The passage in *Bergsonism* opens with Deleuze's presentation of
 Riemann as a physicist and mathematician. This characterisation is less
 obvious than it might seem at first. The importance of Riemann's figure
 and work has always been primarily recognised for its fundamental
 contributions to mathematics (real and complex analysis, number
 theory, differential geometry, topology) while it is only after its
 employment in Einstein's theory of general relativity that it has become
 an integral part of modern mathematical physics. Furthermore, the fact
 that Riemann was considered primarily as a physicist is far from being
 evident or even common. Deleuze's statement requires therefore a more
 attentive consideration.
 To begin with, although Deleuze, throughout his work, sometimes
 refers to Riemann simply as a 'mathematician' (Deleuze and Guattari
 1987: 482), it is again to 'physics and mathematics' that he relates
 what defines the 'Riemann abstract machine' (142). Likewise, although
 referring to Riemannian spaces or manifolds Deleuze links these
 to 'mathematics and physics' (Deleuze 1995: 30), elsewhere he
 reaffirms their relationship to 'the field of physics and mathematics'
 (Deleuze 2006a: 13). Finally-and even more meaningfully -Deleuze
 resorts to the compact expression 'the mathematician and physicist
 Riemann (le mathématicien-physicien Riemann)' (Deleuze and Guattari
 1987: 32/46), and on the occasion of the translation into English
 of *Bergsonism*, writes that the term 'multiplicity' is of 'physico-mathematical
 (Riemann)' origin (Deleuze 2006b: 337). Deleuze's
 characterisation of Riemann in *Bergsonism* is thus not accidental; on
 the contrary, it reflects the Deleuzian reception and understanding of
 Riemann's work as such.
 In fact, Deleuze grasps the core of Riemann's 'philosophy of science',
 that is, the fundamental interrelation between mathematics and physics.[^4]
 As it was for Leibniz, Detlef Laugwitz argues, 'Riemann thought that
 mathematics and physics belong closely together' (Laugwitz 2008: 333).
 This strict relationship is confirmed by several viewpoints. Riemann
 devoted during his brief career and life constant and active research
 to many topics of mathematical physics, such as electrochemistry,
 electromagnetism, theory of heat, and hydrodynamics. A large part
 of his writing and teaching activities was focused on the methods of
 applying differential calculus to physics, in the lineage of Leibniz and
 Newton and of his great masters Gauss, Dirichlet and Weber, as well
 as the background of the French tradition of Laplace, Fourier, Poisson
 and Cauchy. Moreover, several of his writings attest to his attempts to
 elaborate a unified theory of physical forces, such as gravity, electricity,
 magnetism and light.
 But the more important corroboration of Riemann's physico-mathematical
 conception resides in the 1854 Habilitation lecture
 itself. Since it is in this context, as mentioned, that Riemann first
 introduces the concept of (n-dimensional) manifold, this point is of
 decisive importance. In fact, if Riemann's lecture establishes the new
 mathematical foundations of modern geometry (as defined by topology
 or, as it was called at the time, 'analysis situs' and differential geometry),
 its focal point lies nevertheless in the issue of the physical applications of
 the concept of manifold. In other words, what is at stake in Riemann's
 lecture is the relationship between geometry and physics.
 Indeed, the profound originality of Riemann's new approach
 to geometry derives from the fact that, having determined the
 mathematical condition for the construction of infinitely many spaces, or
 n-dimensional manifolds, he demonstrates the possibility to construct
 infinitely many geometries (see Gray 2010: 201), thus going 'far beyond
 the intellectual scheme of both Euclidean and non-Euclidean geometry'
 (Laugwitz 2008: 225). The so-called non-Euclidean geometries are in
 fact only special cases of Riemann's differential geometry. However, the
 possibility to construct infinitely many spaces and geometries imposes
 the most compelling physical question of what is the proper geometry
 of the real space of phenomena. What ultimately interested Riemann,
 in other words, was the problem of the geometry of physical space. As
 Erhard Scholz stresses, 'The main goal of Riemann's inaugural lecture . . .
 was a reformulation of the conceptual foundations of physical geometry '
 (Scholz 1992: 29; emphasis in original). Consequently, the problem that
 Riemann's theory of manifolds points out is, once again, the relationship
 between mathematics and physics.
 This relationship constitutes the fundamental epistemological
 approach of the entire so-called Göttingen Tradition (see Mehra 2001).
 Within this there is a common orientation of thought leading from
 Riemann to Felix Klein, David Hilbert, Hermann Minkowski and, not
 least, precisely to Hermann Weyl. 'No mathematician of the first half
 of the 20th century', writes Laugwitz, 'cared as much as Weyl for
 greater depth of thought in analysis, geometry, mathematical physics,
 and philosophy' (Laugwitz 2008: 274). And in fact, it is Weyl who
 introduced Riemann's theory into twentieth-century mathematics, both
 from the purely mathematical (topological) point of view (Riemann
 surfaces) and for the physico-mathematical implications of Riemannian
 geometry. It is not surprising then if Weyl, in *Space, Time, Matter*,
 presents Riemann's ideas as the 'prophetical' (Weyl 1952: 102/88)
 anticipation of modern mathematical physics, as proven by Einstein's
 general theory of relativity.
 It is in this perspective that Deleuze emphasises the dependence
 of Einstein's theory on Riemann's theory of manifolds, suggesting
 furthermore a hypothesis to found on this basis a possible confrontation
 between Einstein and Bergson (see Deleuze 1988: 39). If for Deleuze,
 therefore, Riemann is inseparably a physicist and a mathematician, as
 well as his theory of spaces or manifolds is inseparably both physical and
 mathematical, it is because of the fact that within the Riemann-Weyl
 lineage Riemann's radically new conception was acknowledged in its
 inherent physico-mathematical correlation.
## II. 'Thing' and Multiplicity: From Riemann to Deleuze
 For Riemann, Deleuze states, 'things' are multiplicities. What defines
 them as such are the parameters (dimensions, independent variables)
 which they are determined by or depend on. With this general
 characterisation, Deleuze seems first of all to focalise Riemann's key
 idea, namely the irreducibility of the manifold concept to any specific
 domain of application, from which derives its power of determination.
 In other words, according to Deleuze, any 'object' is, for Riemann,
 determinable as a multiplicity, regardless of it being a geometric entity,
 an empirical object, a physical phenomenon or a state of things. The
 way in which Weyl presents Riemannian manifolds might confirm that
 Deleuze may have had something similar in mind.
 In introducing the principles underpinning Riemann's 'infinitesimal
 geometry' (differential geometry) Weyl exemplifies the varied use of
 the concept of manifold from mathematics to the natural sciences
 (see Weyl 1952: 84/72-3). These examples show that the concept of
 manifold allows for the definition of geometric entities (e.g. a three
dimensional space), phenomena or states of things (the state space of
 an ideal gas, for instance), sensible objects (such as pure sounds and
 colours), the positions of a body, or a physical system (for example, the
 configuration space of a rigid body or the phase space of a mechanical
 system). Weyl explains that these mathematical and/or physical 'spaces'
 as n-dimensional manifolds, are precisely defined by the values of the
 parameters that determine them, that is, the n coordinates or variables
 they depend on and which characterise their n dimensions. For example,
 the state space of an ideal gas is a two-dimensional manifold because it
 can be determined 'by two independent variables, such as pressure and
 temperature'; 'colours form a three-dimensional manifold with respect
 to quality and intensity' and so on.
 As I would suggest, some key aspects of Deleuze's further
 philosophical elaboration of the Idea as pure multiplicity in Difference
 and Repetition are founded on his interpretation of Riemann-Weyl,
 notwithstanding the reading of Albert Lautman's works remains, as
 known, his primary source. In turn, such aspects can clarify Deleuze's
 claim in the passage of *Bergsonism* that is being analysed. In endorsing
 the 'Riemannian usage of the word "multiplicity"', in Difference and
 Repetition Deleuze writes: 'Everything (chaque chose) is a multiplicity in
 so far as it incarnates an Idea' (Deleuze 1994: 182/236). This state shows
 the double meaning of Deleuze's appropriation of Riemann's thought.
 First, the concept of multiplicity (as substantive) is raised to
 the transcendental field of virtual Ideas, gaining its autonomy and
 irreducibility. However, at the same time it is inseparably related
 to the empirical determination (or actualisation, as a process of
 differentiation and genesis) of 'real [spatio-temporal] relations and
 actual terms' (Deleuze 1994: 183), thus implying its fundamental
 immanence. Weyl's description of Riemann's manifolds exemplifies in
 the field of mathematics and physics this sense of irreducibility and
 complementarity of the manifold concept. As well as for Deleuze the
 Idea is a concrete universal, a Riemannian manifold is a physico-mathematical
 Idea, irreducible to, while remaining inseparable from, any
 empirical effectuation.
 Second, the Idea, for Deleuze, as a substantive (virtual) multiplicity,
 and the immanent production of real (actual) objects, involves
 the complex process of determination of the elements ( dx , dy) of
 the multiplicity (principle of determinability), of their differential
 relations (dy/dx) or their degrees of variation (principle of reciprocal
 determination), and of the values of such relations (values of dy/dx)
 or degrees (principle of complete determination), to which there
 corresponds a distribution of singular points (see Deleuze 1994:
 171, 175). This process of determination, which shows Deleuze's
 philosophical-mathematical interpretation of the differential calculus
 in the constitution of the Idea and its internal (immanent) genetic
 power, is consonant with Weyl's examples. The n-dimensional physico-mathematical
 'spaces' (as manifolds) imply the extension of the
 differential calculus to physics (as well as to geometry), through which
 actual objects, phenomena, phase transitions (in which singular or
 critical points play a crucial role) or states of things are determined.
 Seen in this Riemann-Weyl perspective, some important aspects of the
 well-known Deleuzian definition of the Idea in Difference and Repetition
 thus emerge:
 An Idea is an n-dimensional, continuous, defined multiplicity. Colour - or
 rather, the Idea of colour - is a three-dimensional multiplicity. By dimensions,
 we mean the variables or co-ordinates upon which a phenomenon depends;
 by continuity, we mean the set of relations between changes in these
 variables - for example, a quadratic form of the differentials of the coordinates;
 by definition, we mean the elements reciprocally determined by
 these relations, elements which cannot change unless the multiplicity changes
 its order and its metric. (Deleuze 1994: 182-3)
 The Weylian and Riemannian inspiration for this passage is
 unequivocal, as attested by the example of colour as a three
dimensional multiplicity[^5] or the assertion that phenomena depend on
the parameters (variables, coordinates) that determine the dimension
of the corresponding multiplicity. As for the example concerning the
 continuity of a multiplicity, the reference is to the quadratic differential
 form (that is, the differential expression of the square of the distance
 ds or line element, between infinitesimally neighbouring points) that
 properly defines a Riemannian manifold (or space).[^6]
 Deleuze's claim in *Bergsonism* means therefore that every 'thing',
 'object', 'space' or 'phenomenon' is a multiplicity as it actualises its
 n-dimensional continuous Idea. 'Things' are actual multiplicities (a
 colour, for instance) dependent on the virtual multiplicity (the Idea of
 colour) of differential relations (and singular points) that they embody.
 In turn, the virtual multiplicity remains irreducible to the actual state
 of things. 'Every «thing»', Deleuze would later affirm, 'is made up so
 (Toute «chose» est ainsi faite)' (Deleuze 2006b: 305/284-5; translation
 modified).
## III. Discrete and Continuous Multiplicities: The Problem of Space
 As I would like to show, Deleuze derives Riemann's distinction between
 discrete multiplicities and continuous multiplicities from a close reading
 of an excerpt from Weyl's *Space, Time, Matter*. Interestingly, such an
 excerpt consists of a text overlap between Weyl's explanation of the
 Riemannian distinction and a quotation from Riemann's Habilitation
 lecture. As we shall see, the meaning of this Riemann-Weyl intersection
 will be decisive for the Deleuzian elaboration.
 Having highlighted that both Euclidean and non-Euclidean geometries
 are only special cases within Riemann's infinitely many geometries,
 Weyl stresses the crucial point of Riemann's Habilitation lecture, which
 lies, he states, in its final part (see Weyl 1952: 97/83). According to
 Weyl, the core issue arising from Riemann's conception -an issue that
 could only emerge properly and find adequate response with the theory
 of general relativity -lies in the connection between the (infinitesimal)
 geometry of space and the physical world. More precisely, once all of the
 mathematical and geometrical properties of a Riemannian space have
 been locally and intrinsically determined (that is, in the infinitesimal
 distance between points and without the assumption of a higher
dimensional embedding space), the question is of its compatibility with
 the 'real' space. However, as stated previously, as Riemann outlines the
 conditions for constructing infinitely many spaces and geometries, the
 issue becomes the relationship between geometry and physics itself, and
 hence concerns the very nature of the physical space. For Weyl, this is
 the problem of space, which represents Riemann's ultimate question.
 It is with the purpose of explaining such a crucial point that Weyl
 introduces the Riemannian distinction between discrete manifolds and
 continuous manifolds:
 I must begin by remarking that Riemann contrasts discrete manifolds, i.e.
 those composed of single isolated elements, with continuous manifolds. The
 measure of every part of such a discrete manifold is determined by the
 number of elements belonging to it (La mesure d'une partie quelconque d'une
 multiplicité discrète est donnée par le nombre des éléments qu'elle contient).
 Hence, as Riemann expresses it, a discrete manifold has the principle of
 its metrical relations in itself (une multiplicité discrète porte le principe de
 sa métrique), a priori, as a consequence of the concept of the number.
 In Riemann's own words: The question of the validity of the hypotheses
 of geometry in the infinitely small is bound up with the question of the
 ground of the metrical relations of space. In this question, which we may
 still regard as belonging to the doctrine of space, is found the application
 of the remark made above; that in a discrete manifold, the principle or
 character of its metric relations is already given in the notion of the manifold,
 whereas in a continuous manifold this ground has to be found elsewhere,
 i.e. has to come from outside (dans une variété continue, ce principe doit
 venir d'ailleurs). Either, therefore, the reality which underlies space must
 form a discrete manifold, or we must seek the ground of its metric relations
 (measure-conditions) outside it, in binding forces which act upon it (dans les
 forces de liaison qui agissent en lui). A decisive answer to these questions can
 be obtained only by starting from the conception of phenomena which has
 hitherto been justified by experience, to which Newton laid the foundation,
 and then making in this conception the successive changes required by facts
 which admit of no explanation on the old theory . . . This carries us over into
 the sphere of another science, that of physics.' (Weyl 1952: 97/83-4)
 Although Weyl points out that quantum mechanics might force us
 to assume that the answer to the problem of space could be the first
 hypothesis, i.e. that physical space constitutes a discrete manifold, he
 regards the second -that physical space forms a continuous manifold -as
 more consistent with Riemann's thought (and with the space-time
 continuum of General Relativity). He concludes as follows (see also
 Plotnitsky 2009: 203):
 Riemann rejects the opinion that had prevailed up to his own time, namely,
 that the metrical structure of space was fixed and inherently independent of
 the physical phenomena for which it serves as a background (indépendante
 des phénomènes physiques qui se déroulent dans son sein), and that the
 real content takes possession of it as with residential flats. He asserts, on
 the contrary, that space in itself is nothing more than a three-dimensional
 manifold devoid of all form (une multiplicité tridimensionnelle amorphe); and
 that it acquires a definite form only through the advent of the material content
 filling it and determining its metric relations. (Weyl 1952: 98/84)
 Now, compared with the passage in *Bergsonism*, it is evident that
 Deleuze summarises the Riemannian distinction by extrapolating nearly
 literally from this lengthy excerpt of Weyl, in which, it is noteworthy,
 is inserted a quotation of Riemann. This is one of Riemann's most
 celebrated quotations, taken from the concluding part of his Habilitation
 lecture (see Riemann 2007: 661). The synthesis devised by Deleuze,
 derives therefore from this intersection between Weyl and Riemann,
 from which results -as proof of the arguments outlined above -the very
 Deleuzian understanding of Riemann's thought.
 Indeed, while devoting the first and second part of his lecture to
 the definition of the mathematical concept of n-dimensional manifold
 and to the local and intrinsic differential geometry which it is possible
 to construct upon it, Riemann dedicates the third and last part -from
 which Weyl quotes -to addressing the issue of its applications to space
 (see Riemann 2007: 659): which geometry of space is consistent with
 the empirical world? It is in relation to this question that Riemann's
 distinction between discrete and continuous manifolds -corresponding
 to the distinction between numerical or quantitative magnitudes and
 spatial or topological magnitudes -[^7] gains its decisive relevance. Contrary
 to the Newtonian absolute space (and time) and the Euclidean geometry
 that founds it, Riemann's reply is that the geometry of physical space
 can not be determined a priori. The 'real' space is just a special case
 of manifold (three-dimensional only by 'hypothesis'), which is purely
 informal (topological) in itself ('devoid of all form', as Weyl says),[^8]
 before any metric determination (that is, before the introduction of
 the ds2 form). Therefore, in the passage quoted by Weyl, Riemann
 implies that, as far as the metric relations of space with respect to the
 validity of differential geometry are concerned, the problem remains
 within geometry and is hence un-decidable. From the metric properties
 determined on a manifold, it is indeed impossible to derive a priori
 which manifold corresponds to the physical space. As a consequence, the
 geometry of space can only be determined in relation to physical forces.
 The question about the discrete or continuous nature of the physical
 space must hence necessarily be addressed to another science, namely,
 to physics. As a result, space (and time) ceases to be axiomatically
 presumed as the homogeneous (Euclidean), static (invariable) and
 matter-indifferent (absolute) arena in which material bodies would be
 placed; on the contrary, it becomes the dynamic (variable) expression of
 the fundamental physical interactions themselves.
 Through his Riemann-Weyl synthesis in *Bergsonism*, Deleuze thus
 grasps the double meaning of Riemann's physico-mathematical theory:
 the pure informal (topological) nature and autonomy of the Idea of
 multiplicity, and its essential correlation with the geometry of space
 (time) and physical forces. Developing his rhizomatic multiplicities
 and smooth spaces in *A Thousand Plateaus*, Deleuze reaffirms this
 twofold character, precisely resuming Riemann and Weyl. Like a
 Riemannian space (or rather, its underlying topological space), a smooth
 space is 'an amorphous, nonformal (informel) space' (Deleuze and
 Guattari 1987: 477/595). At the same time, The metrical principle' of
 rhizomatic multiplicities 'is not to be found in a homogeneous milieu
 but resides elsewhere, in forces at work within them, in the physical
 phenomena inhabiting them (dans les forces qui agissent en elles, dans
 les phénomènes physiques qui les occupent)' (31/44).
 
## IV. Riemann's Revolution in the Lineage of Leibniz
 Through the idea of n-dimensional (continuous) manifold, then,
 Riemann found both the mathematical space and the physical space,
 stating also their necessary interrelation. This was the starting point
 of the process of géométrisation of physics that will be fulfilled by
 Einstein's theory, and that is at the core of contemporary mathematical
 physics, especially within what has been called 'the gauge field
 programme' for fundamental interactions (see Cao 1997: ch. 9-11). The
 Riemann-Weyl lineage allows us to bring out some important aspects
 of such developments and show Deleuze's philosophical elaboration
 of them.
 For Riemann, writes Laugwitz, 'the true laws of nature are inherent in
 the infinitely small' (Laugwitz 2008: 261). This claim, for our purposes,
 has two interrelated physico-mathematical meanings, which reveal
 Riemann's deep relationship to Leibniz.[^9] First, it means that physical
 laws are fundamentally expressible through differential equations, that
 is, through the differential calculus, of which Leibniz (along with
 Newton) is, as is known, the founder. For Riemann, in other words,
 the true mathematics for physics is indisputably the differential calculus.
 Analysis (complex and real) has for him the pre-eminence in all
 mathematics, and even his concept of manifold, hence his 'analysis
 situs' and differential geometry, emerge as an extension of the calculus.
 Thus, according to Riemann, natural laws must be searched in a strict
 interrelation between analysis, geometry and physics, and therefore
 inherently described by means of differential equations.
 Second, the claim above implies the idea, already underlined by
 Leibniz, that natural forces can only act by continuous action; that is,
 by local (infinitesimal) contact, and by their progressive transmission
 through the surrounding space. For this reason, as Riemann specifies,
 natural laws are 'in general partial differential equations' (cited in
 Laugwitz 2008: 260), since they involve a change in physical quantities
 dependent on several variables, and not merely one, as with ordinary
 differential equations of classical mechanics (of which Newton's laws
 of motion are the model). This viewpoint proves that, in contrast
 to the idea assumed in Newtonian mechanics of action at a distance
 between bodies (particles or material points), namely, the idea of forces
 acting instantaneously regardless of the distance, Riemann conceived
 of mathematical physics as a field physics (see Laugwitz 2008: 257),
 although he did not arrive at the concept of the field itself, which was
 introduced later by Faraday and Maxwell.
 Now, both aspects of Riemann's view of natural laws in the lineage
 of Leibniz are crucial to Deleuze's philosophical elaboration. With
 regard to the first, it is at this point that we encounter Deleuze's
 second (and otherwise unique) explicit mention of Weyl in his later
 works. In The Fold. Leibniz and the Baroque Deleuze ascribes to Weyl
 the statement for which 'a law of Nature is necessarily a differential
 equation' (Deleuze 1993: 47). However, as has just been seen, such a
 formulation can be traced back precisely to Riemann, revealing thus its
 physico-mathematical sense. Indeed, in one of his seminars on Leibniz,
 Deleuze stated that 'one cannot understand anything about infinitesimal
 analysis if one does not see that all physical equations are by nature
 differential equations' (Deleuze 1980b). Therefore, as I would suggest,
 it is again within the Riemann-Weyl lineage that Deleuze maintains
 that the differential calculus (through the differential relation, dy/dx) is
 what 'made possible this kind of co-penetration of physical reality and
 mathematical calculus' (Deleuze 1980a). Consequently, what Deleuze
 seems to rigorously grasp from Riemann and Weyl is that natural
 laws are 'necessarily' conceived as differential equations, and thus as
 inherently infinitesimal (differential), because in the lineage of Leibniz
 modern analysis, geometry and physics have become the differential
 'sufficient reason' of mathematical physics, that is to say, of the physico
mathematical explanation of Nature.
 This leads us to the second aspect of Riemann's conception of the
 laws of nature. As remarked by Weyl himself (see Weyl 1952: 66),
 Riemann's affinity with Leibniz's continuous and infinitesimal vision
 implies a clear opposition to the Newtonian mechanical model of
 physical interactions and, conversely, a profound proximity to the field
 theories of Faraday and Maxwell: 'The principle of gaining knowledge
 of the external world from the behaviour of its infinitesimal parts is
 the mainspring of the theory of knowledge in infinitesimal physics (la
 physique des actions de contact) as in Riemann's geometry' (Weyl 1952:
 92/79). In this sense, continues Weyl, 'The transition from Euclidean
 geometry to that of Riemann is founded in principle on the same idea
 as that which led from physics based on action at a distance to physics
 based on infinitely near action' (91). In other words, whereas Euclidean
 geometry and Newtonian mechanics are based on global axioms and
 instantaneous interaction at a distance (as in Newton's law of universal
 gravitation), Riemannian geometry and the field physics of Faraday
 and Maxwell are based on the local, intrinsic construction of space
 and on progressive contact interactions, propagating through space (as
 in Faraday's 'lines of force', or rather, field lines, and in Maxwell's
 equations for electromagnetism).[^10]
 Riemann's rejection of action at a distance in favour of a
 field-theoretical approach in the lineage of Leibniz is thus evidence
 that the problem of interactions (forces) is shifted from bodies, and
 their bi-univocal relation (see Deleuze and Guattari 1987: 370), to the
 continuous space (field) between bodies. This fundamental displacement
 discloses the 'continuous-discontinuous' dichotomy, dating back in its
 basic outline to Leibniz and Newton, which characterised nineteenth
century science, as well as its reductionist tendencies (see Deleuze
 and Guattari 1987: 370), becoming finally, as is known, one of the
 main problems of twentieth-century physics after Einstein's quantum
 revolution: namely, the wave-particle duality. Ultimately, with his
 theory of continuous manifolds, Riemann was looking to overcome
 the Euclidean-Newtonian framework of space, time and matter, and to
 provide an entirely new description of the physical space of fundamental
 interactions.

## V. Beyond Leibniz: Riemann's Demand of Opening
 Despite the profound affinity between Leibniz and Riemann, there is
 nevertheless a crucial point of divergence. In A Thousand Plateaus
 and The Fold, Deleuze argues that Riemann's conception, as drawn
 and developed in contemporary mathematics and physics, implies
 a fundamental change of Leibniz's thought, which is consonant
 with the demand of contemporary philosophy (by Whitehead, for
 instance, but even more so in Deleuze's own philosophy) to overcome
 Leibniz's 'monadological' metaphysics. In order to underline Riemann's
 contribution to these neo-Leibnizian tendencies, and thus to show
 Riemann's detachment from Leibniz, Deleuze draws heavily on
 the mathematician and philosopher Gilles Châtelet (1944-99). To
 comprehend Deleuze's ultimate philosophical elaboration of Riemann's
 ideas, it is thus necessary to consider some aspects of Châtelet's writings.
 In his paper entitled *Sur une petite phrase de Riemann*,[^11] Châtelet
 focalises the critical point posed by Riemann in the conclusion of
 his Habilitation lecture, of which we have already seen the relevance
 for Weyl and Deleuze.[^12] Interweaving the 'continuous-discontinuous'
 dichotomy implied in Riemann's text with Leibniz's concept of monad,
 Châtelet observes:
 How to found the metric of physical space? If this space were discrete, a
 natural class of metrics would be imposed immediately because the discrete
 tolerate only a limited proximity for each of the elements. But space is
 given as a continuous manifold in mathematical physics, if one admits the
 possibility of communication between monads , communication provided
 by the transmission of signals that follow the path of greatest proximity.
 (Châtelet 2010: 91; emphasis in original on the word 'continuous')
 With this argument, Châtelet underlines a decisive problem. Once
 accepted the Riemannian hypothesis for which physical space is a
 continuous manifold indiscernible from physical phenomena, it becomes
 necessary to admit local interactions (or 'communication', as Châtelet
 terms it), which can be transmitted through space. Châtelet has here
 clearly in mind Maxwell's and Einstein's theories. 'General relativity',
 he writes, indeed provides 'an answer to Riemann's question' (Châtelet
 2010: 92).
 But the problem lies elsewhere. As we have seen, the admission of local
 interactions corresponds to Riemann's field-theoretical approach to
 mathematical physics. This entails the idea of action by contact, contrary
 to the idea of action at a distance assumed in Newtonian mechanics.
 Nevertheless, and here is the point, to admit local interactions involves at
 the same time a criticism addressed to one of the fundamental conditions
 of Leibniz's monadology: the condition of absolute closure which defines
 the monads (see Deleuze 1993: 22-26, 81-2). Contrary to Newton
 (or more prudently, to the Newtonians), Leibniz advocated the idea
 of action by contact, as something expressing the physical mechanism
 of extrinsic movement. However, since each monad, in its closure,
 integrally includes the totality of the world, all action must necessarily
 be internal to the monad. Consequently, in Leibniz's metaphysics there
 is by no means, in the narrow sense, a proper idea of interaction between
 monads.
 It follows that Riemann's hypothesis, regained and proven in modern
 physics, compels the rejection of the condition of closure which defines
 Leibnizian monads, demanding on the contrary a condition of opening.
 This 'openness' implies, according to Châtelet, 'communication' and
 'coexistence', founded in the infinitesimal (differential) proximity of
 interactions. In other words, and in terms later resumed by Deleuze (see
 Deleuze and Guattari 1987: 485, 493, 574), 'differentiation', Châtelet
 writes, 'propagates step-by-step (de proche en proche) in this community
 of monads which involve tactile relations described by a kind of tension
 which might be called connection' (Châtelet 2010: 90; emphases in
 original). Now, without entering into technical details, it is nevertheless
 important to understand the origin and meaning of the term 'connection'
 as used here by Châtelet for describing interactions.

## VI. The Genesis of Fibre Bundle Topology and Gauge Field Theory
 In his paper on Riemann, Châtelet employs the modern mathematical
 and physical notion of 'connection' in its current understanding -as is
 meant in the mathematical theory of fibre bundles (bundle connection)
 and in physical gauge field theories (gauge connection).[^13] Despite the
 independent development of these theories (at least to a certain extent,
 as we will see), I wish to first of all emphasise that their historical genesis
 can be traced back precisely to the works of Weyl, and specifically, to
 his extensions of Riemannian geometry and Einstein's general theory of
 relativity.
 The original notion of 'connection', first introduced in 1917 by Levi
Civita in his work on the parallel transport of vectors in Riemannian
 geometry, was further developed by Weyl -and also in the fundamental
 works of the French mathematician Élie Cartan (1869-1951) -in his
 'purely infinitesimal geometry' (see Scholz 2001). Weyl started by
 liberating Levi-Civita's notion of parallel transport from its dependence
 on a metric, and the embedding of the Riemannian manifold on
 which parallelism is defined into an external Euclidean tangent space.
 Levi-Civita's parallelism was, in fact, an extrinsic notion, in conflict
 with Riemann's conception of geometry. Indeed, as underlined by
 Lautman, one of the decisive aspects of Riemannian geometry is
 that it is an intrinsic differential geometry. The space (as manifold)
 and its properties (curvature, for instance) are defined without any
 reference to an external ambient space, a 'universal container' (Lautman
 2011: 112), as Newton's absolute space. Following Cartan, Lautman
 shows how Levi-Civita's notion of parallelism (which Cartan called
 'Euclidean connection') on Riemannian manifolds entailed instead the
 introduction of the extrinsic and external viewpoint considering the
 manifold 'as embedded in a Euclidean space to a sufficient number of
 dimensions' (113). Indeed, Lautman points out, 'the exterior tangent
 planes, the projections and the rotations implied by the parallelism of
 Levi-Civita only make sense with respect to the space in which the
 manifold is embedded' (115).
 Weyl is credited with having achieved the first intrinsic formulation
 of parallelism by elaborating the concept of 'affine connection' (now
 called 'linear connection') on (differentiable) manifolds, subsequently
 extended to the 'projective' and 'conformal' cases. The concept of
 'affine connection' was conceived for the mathematical (geometrical)
 description of (continuous) infinitesimal displacements of vectors in
 tangent (affine) spaces over manifolds. However, in Weyl's main
 intentions, such a concept had first of all a physical meaning within
 the framework of his attempt to formulate a unified field theory
 of the fundamental interactions known at the time (gravity and
 electromagnetism), thus also incorporating Einstein's theory of general
 relativity.[^14]
 In this context, according to Weyl, for reaching a 'purely' local and
 intrinsic infinitesimal geometry it was first necessary to remove from
 Riemannian geometry the presence of what he understood as a last
 vestige of the Euclidean 'geometry at a distance' (Weyl 1952: 102),
 something also present in Einstein's theory, namely, the possibility of a
 direct comparison of lengths (specifically, the length of vectors) located
 at distant points. The most important consequence of Weyl's approach
 was that it involved a path-dependence of spatial and temporal lengths;
 that is, a local change in the length scale from point to point of
 space-time. This locality entailed a relativity of the standard of length
 (or unit of scale), and therefore the existence of variable scale factors.
 This is what Weyl expressed by introducing the idea of a gauge system
 (see Cao 1997: 105-6, 271-73), for which he required a necessary gauge
 invariance, that is, an independence with respect to any particular choice
 of unit length (or gauge). Thereby, Weyl's unified field theory represents
 the first formulation of a local gauge theory.
 Nevertheless, although Weyl's theory was applauded at first, above
 all by Einstein himself, the latter addressed soon thereafter some cogent
 criticisms, showing that this was in conflict with physical observations,
 hence revealing its failure. Towards the end of the 1920s, Weyl's further
 research, partly solicited by the discovery of two new fundamental
 interactions (the weak and the strong), convinced him to utilise the
 gauge idea in the context of quantum mechanics, although in a suitably
 modified manner (precisely, not as a scale factor but as a phase factor
 of the wave function of quantum particles). This reformulation is the
 foundation of the modern meaning of the gauge principle (see Cao 1997:
 271-5, 332-8), which stimulated new programmes of unification for the
 fundamental interactions within the framework of quantum field theory.
 Starting from these developments, a decisive step was achieved in the
 1950s by the elaboration of modern gauge field theories (the so-called
 Yang-Mills' theories) that constitute today the core of the Standard
 Model of elementary particle physics.
 From the mathematical point of view, starting from the 1930s,
 Weyl's (and Cartan's) general concept of 'connection' on manifolds
 was extended and reworked in the theory of topological fibred spaces ,
 thanks to the major contributions to algebraic and differential topology
 provided by mathematicians like Hopf, Seifert, Whitney, Serre and
 Ehresmann.[^15] The last had by the mid-1940s introduced the concept
 of 'infinitesimal connection' on fibred spaces, leading to the first 'global
 theory of connections'. Finally, Norman Steenrod published in 1951 the
 first monograph on the topology of fibre bundles (see Steenrod 1951),
 providing what has since become the modern meaning of this field of
 mathematics.[^16]
 Intuitively, a fibre bundle can be thought as a kind of 'enlarged'
 topological space composed by a base space B (an n-dimensional
 manifold) and a total space E (or bundle space) 'above' the base space
 (generally, the total space is endowed with a group structure, in which
 case the fibre bundle defines what is known as a principal fibre bundle).
 The total space is composed by the fibres F, in correspondence with each
 point X of the base space. The simplest example of a fibre bundle is
 the so-called product space (E being equal to the product of B with F),
 which is a trivial fibre bundle; for example, a cylinder, with a circle as a
 base space and a line segment as the fibre. A classical example of a non
trivial fibre bundle, in contrast, is the Möbius strip , which resembles the
 product space locally, but not globally (it is 'twisted'). It is important to
 note first that each fibre is in itself an m-dimensional manifold. Thus, a
 fibre bundle is not simply a multi-dimensional space as any Riemannian
 or other topological spaces generally are, but a (n+m)-dimensional space.
 Second, and most importantly, the total space is in contact with the
 base, through the bundle projection (a continuous map) -the third basic
 component of the fibre bundle- which acts from the total space E to the
 base space B (n : £ -► B). This means that the total space is extrinsic ,
 in Lautman's sense, to the base space, but not external to it. In other
 words, the total space is formally distinct from, and irreducible to, the
 base space, but this does not imply that the total space need be conceived
 as a higher-dimensional ambient space in which the base space would be
 embedded. On the contrary, each fibre of the total space is an internal
 space, constituting the internal dimensions of the fibre bundle, although
 they are the extra dimensions of it. Finally, a bundle connection is an
 additional geometric structure that permits to compare infinitesimally
 neighbouring fibres and to describe the paths connecting them.
 The topology of fibre bundles marks a theoretical renewal of
 Riemannian geometry. However, it must be noted that during the
 1950s, when fibre bundle theory and gauge field theory had achieved
 their modern formulation, such theories were completely independent
 and unrelated to each other despite their common origins (Riemannian
 geometry, Einstein's general relativity and unified field theories). For this
 reasons, what is more important to stress here is that in the mid-1970s
 the physicists T. T. Wu and C. N. Yang were astonished to realise that
 gauge theories could be reframed and adequately formulated precisely
 through the mathematics of fibre bundle topology; we shall return
 to this in more detail. Moreover, this profound relationship between
 physical theories and topological-geometrical structures allowed for
 the understanding of a similarity between gauge theories and the
 theory of general relativity itself (see Cao 1997: 334). Ultimately, these
 extraordinary results have finally led to a new and more profound
 understanding of the interdependence between mathematics and physics.

## VII. The Contemporary Physico-Mathematical Space and Deleuze's Plane of Immanence
 Precisely these developments underlie Châtelet's interpretation and
 Deleuze's ultimate philosophical elaboration of Riemann's thought.
 The interrelation between mathematics and physics envisaged by
 Riemann's differential geometry and field-theoretical approach to
 physics, is by Châtelet understood in deep continuity with contemporary
 mathematical physics, as evidenced by fibre bundle topology, gauge field
 theories and modern interpretations of general relativity.[^17]
 In his paper *Le potentiel démoniaque. Aspects philosophiques et
 physiques de la théorie de Jauge*,[^18] Châtelet proposes an interpretation
 of gauge theory in its fibre bundle formulation, showing how it
 definitively breaks the 'idealised' model of Euclid-Newton's space,
 time and matter, establishing, on the contrary, the 'effective' space of
 what he calls, evocatively, 'fibre-monads' (also 'fibre-particles'). The
 revolutionary aspect of gauge theory, Châtelet suggests, lies in the
 definitive abandonment of the 'pure' (i.e. absolute) representation of
 classical (pre-Riemannian and pre-Einsteinian) geometry and physics,
 affirming instead the inseparable 'coupling' of mathematical structures
 and physical reality. In this way, Châtelet writes in a crucial passage,
 'through the simultaneous dissolution of the categories of «purely
 geometrical» and «purely physical», it [the gauge theory] establishes
 a proper physico-mathematical space' (Châtelet 2010: 95; emphasis
 in original). How, then, does the gauge theory of elementary particle
 physics and fibre bundle topology attain this 'space'?
 'Each monad [i.e., particle]', Châtelet writes, 'testing a path in the
 universe B [i.e., in the base space of the fibre bundle] establishes
 a kind of synthesis associated to each path' (Châtelet 2010: 100).
 This extremely succinct passage -which, as we shall see, will be
 taken up by Deleuze -condenses some key aspects of how the
 topological-geometrical structure of fibre bundles actually operates
 within gauge theory. To understand this, let us begin by briefly
 summarising some of the basic features of gauge field theory.[^19]
 According to the Standard Model of particle physics, of which gauge
 theories represent the theoretical framework, elementary (quantum)
 particles are quanta indissolubly coupled to quantum fields. This
 means that all quantum particles are field quanta. Quantum fields are
 distinguished into two main types: (fermionic) matter fields, and their
 associated particles (fermions), such as electrons and quarks; (bosonic)
 force fields, and their associated particles (bosons), such as photons
 and gluons. In gauge theory, force fields are known as gauge fields.
 Since these are the quantum fields that describe (non-gravitational)
 fundamental interactions, namely, electromagnetic, weak and strong
 forces, gauge fields are also defined as interaction fields. While fermions
 are actual quanta of matter (that is, the constituent of 'ordinary' matter),
 bosons are conceived as virtual quanta of force (interaction), and are
 called gauge bosons. Gauge bosons are virtual particles responsible for
 the transmission of interactions. For instance, photons are the gauge
 bosons that mediate electromagnetic interactions. In a nutshell, gauge
 theory can then be thought of as the quantum field theory of matter
 (matter fields) and force (force fields).
 However, more important are the interactions between matter and
 force. Indeed, one of the key aspects revealed by quantum field theory
 is that in order for a quantum particle to exist, it must interact with
 some quantum field. In other words, a universe without interactions can
 not exist at all. Accordingly, since quantum particles are manifestations
 of interacting quantum fields, gauge theory is the theory that describes
 the dynamic processes of interaction between matter (matter fields) and
 force (force fields).
 A quantum particle (as a quantum of matter field) interacting with
 a gauge field (force field) is affected by it. The resulting effect is
 observable as a change in the internal states of the particle (for
 example, a phase change in the wave function). What is the effective
 cause of this change? In classical field theories (Maxwell's theory of
 electromagnetism, for instance), changes were entirely ascribed to the
 influence of the (electromagnetic) field, or rather, its strength, that is, the
 intensity of the field. Mathematically, however, the problem is that for
 calculating the field strength one has to introduce some potential (for
 example, the electric scalar potential and the magnetic vector potential
 in the case of electromagnetism) in the form of potential functions,
 which allows to represent the 'tension' (to use Châtelet's expression in
 a previously quoted passage) of the field. The fundamental potentials in
 gauge theory are called gauge potentials. What is their more precise role
 and why are potentials problematic?
 The point is that potentials have always had an ambiguous status
 within physics, beginning with their well-known 'arbitrariness'. The
 electric and magnetic potentials in Maxwell's equations, for instance, are
 invariant under a gauge transformation, that is, they leave the electric
 and magnetic fields completely unchanged. Thus, are the potentials
 actual physical entities, as fields are, or are they simply useful, but
 conventional and arbitrary mathematical devices permitting calculations
 for deriving fields? For our purposes it is sufficient to highlight that
 during the last fifty years important experiments have in fact established
 the physical reality of potentials, stating the fact that they determine
 observable effects not entirely attributable to the field strength (the most
 important example here is the so-called Aharonov-Bohm effect).[^20] In
 short, such experiments have demonstrated that the phase differences of
 quantum particles interacting with gauge fields are physically determined
 precisely by the gauge potentials. Therefore, they are not merely
 mathematical tools, but the field strength, or gauge field strength, is
 a quantity derived from them. In sum, gauge field potentials are the
 effective cause of changes in the internal states of matter fields.
 What relationship can there be between such aspects of gauge
 field theory and fibre bundle topology? As previously mentioned,
 this is precisely what Wu and Yang proved in the mid-1970s. Fibre
 bundles provide the topological-geometrical structure that describes the
 dynamics of quantum field (matter fields and gauge fields) interactions.
 What Wu and Yang demonstrated was that gauge fields are principal
 fibre bundles (with a so-called Lie group as symmetry group), in
 which the base space is the space-time manifold, while the total space
 describes the dynamics of the internal states of interacting matter and
 force quantum fields (where force fields are principal fibre bundles and
 matter fields are so-called associated vector bundles). Each fibre at any
 space-time point thus corresponds to the internal (extra) dimension (the
 internal symmetry space) of quantum fields. In other words, the total
 space of the fibre bundle can be thought of as the 'space of phases' of
 a quantum particle moving through the base space (the space-time) and
 interacting with a quantum field (an electromagnetic field, for instance).
 As we have seen, phase differences are physically determined by the
 gauge potentials of the gauge field. In the fibre bundle formulation gauge
 potentials are identified with the bundle connection, which describes
 the changes of the phase (amounting to a kind of 'twisting' of the
 fibres) along a path at different space-time points. The corresponding
 gauge field strength is then instead associated to the curvature of the
 connection. Because phase changes imply the curvature of the connection
 to be non-zero (that is, not 'flat'), the topology of the fibre bundle in
 gauge theories is, in general, 'twisted', which is to say, non-trivial.[^21]
 This is what encloses Châtelet's passage quoted above. The space-time
 paths of the 'monads' (particles) in the base space are correlated to the
 fibres in the internal (extra) dimensions of the total space (the 'space
 of phases'). This space, through the connection (the gauge potential)
 and its curvature (the gauge field strength), 'synthesises' the dynamics
 of the fundamental interactions. The potential, associated with the
 connection, 'creates the quanta of the force field' (Châtelet 2010: 106),
 namely, the virtual particles (gauge bosons) of the interaction field
 (gauge field), while by the non-zero curvature of the connection 'the
 monad experiences the rebellion of space to every capture through
 a Cartesian grid ( quadrillage )' (106), that is, through a trivial fibre
 bundle. The non-zero curvature indicates thus the non-trivial ('twisted')
 nature of space, or, as Châtelet stresses, the 'heterogeneity of space'
 (105; emphasis in original). The fibre bundle formulation of gauge
 theory then describes, Châtelet suggests, the open space of the virtual
 'potentialities' and 'intensities' of matter, where the 'monads' (particles)
 are necessarily coupled to the 'fibres' (quantum fields), which are
 themselves 'affected by the indomitable exteriority of the others' (100).
 In brief, the 'fibre-monads' are necessarily modified by interaction
 processes of matter and force. Ultimately, through the identification of
 the connection (a topological-geometrical notion) with the potential
 (finally an experimentally stated physical entity), the mathematical
 physics of fibre bundle topology and gauge field theory fulfils the
 condition of opening originally demanded by Riemann, and attains the
 neo-Leibnizian perspective of the contemporary physico-mathematical
 space.
 This is exactly what Deleuze derives from Châtelet, condensing in a
 short but illuminating passage in The Fold what he defines as 'the new
 monadology in mathematics since Riemann' (Deleuze 1993: 154, n. 16):
 Modern mathematics has been able to develop a fibered conception according
 to which 'monads' test the paths in the universe and enter in syntheses
 associated with each path. It is a world of captures instead of closures.
 (Deleuze 1993: 81)
 As should be evident, this passage paraphrases that by Châtelet
 which we have analysed above, thus revealing which mathematical
 and physical implications it makes implicit reference to.[^22] What is
 important for Deleuze here is that such aspects of contemporary
 science enable him to point out one of the major limits of Leibniz's
 metaphysics, that is, the condition of absolute closure which grounds
 his monadology, and therefore to show the difference with what he
 defines as the neo-Leibnizianism which characterises contemporary
 philosophy. Indeed, contrary to Leibniz's monadic closure, and to
 the requisites of convergence and compossibility, the contemporary
 universe, Deleuze argues, is a 'chaosmos', an open world in becoming,
 in which 'Beings are pushed apart, kept open through divergent series
 and incompossible totalities that pull them outside' (Deleuze 1993: 81).
 However, this outside, as we shall see, is not an external, supplementary,
 dimension, but the intrinsic opening to the field of interactions, to
 'changing captures' (81), in which 'the monads penetrate each other, are
 modified' (137).
 As a consequence of this affirmation of openness and interaction
 in accordance with contemporary science, Leibniz's 'monadological'
 metaphysics, as Deleuze had underlined already in A Thousand Plateaus ,
 must be replaced by a new 'nomadological' perspective (see also
 Plotnitsky 2009: 206):
 Although the 'monads' are no longer thought to be closed upon themselves,
 and are postulated to entertain direct, step-by-step (de proche en proche)
 local relations, the purely monadological point of view proves inadequate and
 should be superseded by a 'nomadology' (the ideality of striated space versus
 the realism of smooth space). (Deleuze and Guattari 1987: 574, n.27/616,
 n.26)
 The classical 'ideality' of Euclid-Newton's space, time and matter,
 and also the conditions of closure, convergence and compossibility of
 Leibniz's monadology, are thus rejected in favour of the nomadological
 realism of the contemporary physico-mathematical space.
 Deleuze's philosophical elaboration in his late works finds therefore
 a deep correlation with contemporary mathematical physics. Deleuze's
 theory of rhizomatic multiplicities and smooth spaces discloses the
 field of interactions, and thus the connection and heterogeneity
 of multiplicities (see Deleuze and Guattari 1987: 7). Deleuze's
 famous description of a Riemannian space as 'pure patchwork' finds
 here its original sense: an heterogeneous, 'amorphous collection' of
 infinitesimally neighbouring 'patches' of space, the connections of
 which are not predetermined, and 'do not imply an ambient space in
 which the multiplicity would be immersed' (493). Like the internal
 (extra) dimensions of fibred spaces in gauge theory that 'capture'
 fundamental interactions, Deleuze's field of interactions characterises the
 open space of 'extrinsic coexistence', the plane or 'milieu of exteriority'
 of connections, as 'extrinsic relations' (435, 353).
 However, this extrinsic field of interactions and connections should
 not be confused with an external dimension that could encompass
 the multiplicities. On the contrary, just as the internal dimensions
 of a fibre bundle, as we have seen, are extrinsic without being
 external, Deleuze's multiplicities (as well as Riemannian manifolds)
 also have no supplementary dimensions of embedding (see Deleuze and
 Guattari 1987: 9). For this reason, Deleuze, following Lautman, opposes
 the connection of Riemannian spaces ('accumulation'), or smooth
 spaces, with what he terms 'Euclidean conjunction' (486, 573, n. 19).
 Indeed, the latter, Deleuze argues, consists in overlaying 'upon each
 point of smooth space a tangent Euclidean space endowed with a
 sufficient number of dimensions' and then in reintroducing 'parallelism
 between two vectors, treating multiplicity as though it were immersed in
 this homogeneous and striated space' (373, 556, n. 39). The 'Euclidean
 conjunction' to which Deleuze refers corresponds therefore to nothing
 other than Levi-Civita's parallel transport of vectors on Riemannian
 manifolds (that is, an 'Euclidean connection' in Cartan's terminology),
 which, as we have seen, precisely implied an extrinsic and external
 viewpoint, opposed to Riemann's intrinsic differential geometry.[^23] Thus,
 I would suggest, Deleuze's field of interactions (and connections) and
 the multiplicities might be then conceived of more adequately as a (non
trivial) fibre bundle, in which the base space would correspond to the
 multiplicities and the total space to the internal (extra) dimensions of
 interactions and connections, a virtual field of 'heterogeneous potentials
 and intensities' (Deleuze 1994: 50).
 This entails that the condition of opening affirmed by Deleuze does
 not imply that the field of interactions (and connections) constitutes
 an external space with respect to the multiplicities, while defining a
 proper and irreducible 'milieu'. To better understand this point, let us
 return briefly to Deleuze's interpretation of Leibniz's monadic structure.
 Despite the condition of closure, Deleuze shows that even Leibniz's
 monad possesses 'a minimum of outside', however, as he states, 'a
 strictly complementary form of outside' (Deleuze 1993: 111). What is
 of interest to us is that, in elucidating this kind of complementarity,
 Deleuze refers to the topological property of 'unilaterality' of the monad,
 which implies 'a torsion of the world, an infinite fold, that can be
 unwrapped (se déplier) in conformity with the condition [of closure]
 only by recovering the other side, not as exterior to the monad, but
 as the exterior or outside of its own interiority' (111/149). The topology
 that Deleuze has in mind here is thus precisely that of a Möbius strip
 (see also Deleuze 1990: 20, n. 10, 337), which, as we have seen, is itself a
 non-trivial fibre bundle. Indeed, in The Logic of Sense Deleuze, following
 Lautman, had already underlined that to grasp the one-sided character of
 the Möbius strip it is necessary to split it 'by unfolding it in its length (en
 le dépliant dans sa longueur), by untwisting it (en le détordant)' (Deleuze
 1990: 20/31; translation modified). According to Lautman, this proves
 that the unilaterality is an extrinsic (or 'relational') property 'since, to
 be realised, it is necessary to split the ring and untwist it, which implies
 a rotation around an axis exterior to the surface of the ring' (Lautman
 2011: 117). For this reason, Deleuze maintains it is only by 'unfolding'
 the surface that 'the dimension of sense [i.e. the outside] appears of
 itself, in its irreducibility, and also in its genetic power' (Deleuze 1990:
 20). Nevertheless, it can be shown that the unilaterality is reducible to
 the Möbius strip's intrinsic property of being non-orientable, that is,
 'folded' and 'twisted' (non-trivial) in itself (see Lautman 2011: 117-8).
 Therefore, the outside is strictly complementary (not exterior, or rather,
 not external) to the monad because, as with a Möbius strip, the extrinsic
 property of unilaterality is equivalent to the intrinsic property of non
orientability. At the same time, however, this equivalence does not
 eliminate the difference and heterogeneity (irreducibility) of the outside
 with respect to the monad.
 Deleuze conceives of the relationship between the field of interactions
 (and connections) and the multiplicities, in the same manner. If there
 is between them a reciprocal irreducibility, which assures an extrinsic
 (outside) dimension of openness, at the same time, they also possess
 a strict complementarity that prevents any kind of transcendence. The
 field of interactions (and connections) corresponds then to what Deleuze
 calls the 'plane of consistency' of multiplicities, which defines precisely
 their internal exteriority; that is, their pure immanence. Indeed, the
 plane of consistency constitutes the 'outside of all multiplicities', whose
 dimensions 'increase with the number of connections that are made
 on it' (Deleuze and Guattari 1987: 9), while remaining a single, pure
 plane of immanence: the 'not-external outside and the not-internal
 inside', or simply, the 'absolute outside' (Deleuze and Guattari 1994:
 59-60). Ultimately, the topology of Deleuze's plane of immanence, as
 field of interactions and connections, and the multiplicities which fill it,
 appears to be that of a kind of folded and twisted (non-trivial) fibre
 bundle, which finds its correlate in the physico-mathematical space of
 contemporary science.

[^5]: The example of colour, as a continuous manifold, is already present in Riemann's lecture (see Riemann 2007: 653). Deleuze's other source for this point (as in general for Riemann's theory) is certainly Jules Vuillemin, which refers to Helmholtz (see Vuillemin 1962: 409, n. 2).
[^6]: Deleuze's source for the differential quadratic form of a Riemannian space is Lautman (2011: 97-8), which depends on Cartan and Weyl. See Weyl 1952: 90.
[^7]: For discussion on Riemann's distinction see, for example, Laugwitz 2008: 305-8, and in relation to Deleuze, Plotnitsky 2006.
[^8]: The French term 'amorphe' would become a typical Deleuzian characterisation of Riemannian manifolds, as well as of smooth spaces (see Deleuze and Guattari 1987: 476, 477, 485, 488). See also Lautman 2011: 98, and for an analysis, Plotnitsky 2006.
[^9]: On Riemann and Leibniz see Laugwitz 2008, but also, in relation to Deleuze, see Plotnitsky 2009.
[^10]: This correlation established by Weyl between Riemannian geometry and Faraday-Maxwell field theory is also analysed by Charles Alunni (2006), showing its relevance for Bachelard.
[^11]: Originally published in 1979, this paper is now included in the new edition of Châtelet's works (see Châtelet 2010: 85-94). All quotations of Châtelet are my translations.
[^12]: Note that the phrase by Riemann to which the 'Proustian' title of Châtelet's paper refers is precisely that which we encountered in Weyl, and that Deleuze synthesises in *Bergsonism*.
[^13]: For an introduction to fibre bundles and bundle connections, see, for example, Isham 2001: ch. 5, 6; Penrose 2005: ch. 15. For an historical account see Bourguignon 1992.
[^14]: For all these aspects see Coleman and Korté 2001. For an historical reconstruction of Weyl's theory in the framework of the attempts of unified field theories in the early twentieth century, see the excellent study of P. V. Vizgin 2011.
[^15]: Note, en passant, that Ehresmann, the first great scholar of Cartan, was a close friend of Lautman. On the relevance of this friendship for Lautman's philosophy of mathematics, see the challenging remarks laid out by Fernando Zalamea in his introduction to Lautman's works (Lautman 2011: xxxv, 267, n. 14).
[^16]: For the historical developments of fibre bundle topology from the strict mathematical (algebraic and topological) viewpoint see Dieudonné 2009.
[^17]: As Châtelet himself observes, 'modern presentations of general relativity by the mathematical physicists utilize always more the language of "fibred spaces" ("fibres")' (Châtelet 2010: 290, n. 15).
[^18]: For indications about the various versions and published forms of this paper see Châtelet 2010: 302.
[^19]: It is clearly beyond the scope of the present paper to provide a detailed discussion of gauge theory. For a detailed account see Zeidler 2011, and for philosophical analyses see Brading and Castellani 2003; Healey 2007.
[^20]: Note that, in another important paper, Châtelet too, discusses the Aharonov-Bohm effect, considering it as a compelling example of the new physico-mathematical space introduced by gauge theory (see Châtelet 2010: 109-31).
[^21]: The fibre bundle is trivial in the Abelian case of quantum electrodynamics (in the absence of magnetic monopoles), while it is non-trivial in the more general non-Abelian Yang-Mills' theories for the weak and strong interactions.
[^22]: Note that Deleuze always refers to Châtelet's paper on Riemann, although the passage cited here from *The Fold* is clearly extrapolated from the second paper by Châtelet that we have considered. This proves, given their relationship as colleagues and friends, that Deleuze must have read Châtelet's paper on gauge theory, at least in one of its versions.
[^23]: Note Deleuze's subtle conceptual displacement between 'Euclidean connection' and 'Euclidean conjunction' for indicating Levi-Civita's parallelism, and the opposition between the latter and the proper 'connection' of Riemannian spaces ('accumulation'); see Deleuze and Guattari 1987: 486, 510.
