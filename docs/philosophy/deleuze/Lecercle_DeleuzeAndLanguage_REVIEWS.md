 Inspired by what is arguably one of Deleuzeʼs most
enduring and illuminating notions, that of the problem,
Lecercleʼs thesis is that language is simultaneously a
privileged medium through which to reconstruct the
originality of Deleuzeʼs philosophical project and a
manner of elucidating its internal fault lines and displacements.
In the process of bolstering this thesis,
Lecercle offers us something like the ideal-type of
the commentary: a remarkably comprehensive and
commendably lucid account of what he rightly calls
Deleuzeʼs ʻpart theoriesʼ of language, ranging from
the thesis of the incorporeality of sense to the programme
of a general semiotics in the collaborations
with Guattari. Moreover, sensitive to the shifting motivations
of Deleuzeʼs philosophy, he demonstrates that
the theme of language is arguably the crucial factor
in assessing both Deleuzeʼs complex relationship to
structuralism and his possible contributions to a literary
aesthetics (this last being the chief desideratum for
Lecercle himself).
Interestingly, where Deleuze is characteristically
allusive and often elliptical in his treatments of linguistic
theories and literary texts, mining them for
their formulas (Bartlebyʼs ʻI would prefer not toʼ)
rather than for their internal dynamics or cultural repercussions,
Lecercle applies his considerable technical
and terminological know-how to making the formerʼs
approach to language explicit. This is both one of
the strengths of the book and something like a performative
disavowal of its own basic platform. One is
struck by the divergence in styles of thought between
the commentator and his object. Lecercleʼs detailed
treatment of the internal articulations and the myriad
operators of linguistic usage – on show in particular
in his clever ʻinterludesʼ, where rigorous eclecticism
replaces addenda to the Deleuzean corpus, or in his
detailed reading of the incipit of the Anti-Oedipus – shows an ability to think inside sentences, to unfold the
speculative content that permeates literary creativity,
which, I would argue, is very much alien to
Deleuze (and, incidentally, rather reminiscent of the
essays of the American novelist W.H. Gass).
Lecercleʼs felicitously heterodox ʻapplicationsʼ of
Deleuzean notions to literary texts, which have the
immense virtue of eschewing the bane of secondary
literature, that of watered-down paraphrase, seek to
give philosophical rights of citizenship to a motley
fauna of literary concepts (antimetabole, anaphora,
antanaclasis, anapaestis, hypotax, paratax, zeugma,
paronomasia, etc.). Alternatively, Deleuzeʼs work most
often disregards the conceptual tools immanent to a
pre-constituted domain (e.g. tropes in the analysis of
rhetoric and textual construction), preferring to this
the extraction of novel concepts, which are ultimately
intra-philosophical and need not bear any resemblance
to those employed by the practitioners in question,
be they linguists or cinematographers, biologists or
political theorists. In the end, one feels that Deleuzeʼs
preference for literature over linguistics, the sources
and style of which are amply traced by Lecercle, is
predicated on the greater ease of a free extraction of
concepts, and is founded on a rather romantic notion
of creativity, whereby the ordinary creativity of linguistic
utterance (of the kind tirelessly advocated by
Chomsky) is demoted in favour of the extraordinary,
impersonal and ontological creativity of the arts.
Lecercleʼs twist on this preference, summarized in
the formula ʻphilosophy is the natural metalanguage
of literature, and literature of philosophyʼ, strikes me
as far too tidy: it is only to the extent that literature
enacts Deleuzeʼs vitalist ontology of creativity that it
demands philosophical capture, but there is no sense in
which Deleuze is promoting a philosophy of literature,
of the kind that would wish to serve as the matrix for
a potentially infinite collection of ʻreadingsʼ.
Throughout the book, the method of the correlation,
which involves the creation of two antagonistic
and asymmetrical series, matched term by term, is
enlisted in the gigantomachy between the Deleuzean
hero, the poet-philosopher of subversive agrammaticality,
and the Chomskyan bogeyman, the state linguist
of binary arborescence in search of binding universal
constants. In line with Deleuze and Guattariʼs own
ʻPostulates of Linguisticsʼ in A Thousand Plateaus,
Lecercle stages a battle between two models of formalization
or abstraction: a mathematizable positing
of deep universals and a descriptive diagrammatic or cartographic
study of variations. Loosely resurrecting
Lakatosʼs terminology, he tells us that we are faced
with the struggle between two research programmes
on language.

Despite the persuasive advocacy of Lecercle, however,
it is difficult to shake off the impression that
Deleuzeʼs relative indifference to the sort of analysis
performed by Lecercle reveals the glad tidings of
a Deleuzean research programme as a dead letter.
After all, the genre of formalization and abstraction
proposed here, a diagrammatic method in the last
instance indifferent to any regional ontologies whatsoever,
is precisely aimed at denying the existence of an
individualizable object domain that would undergird
such a programme in the first place. Whatʼs more,
since Lecercleʼs parti pris is with literature (both its
creation and its analysis) and the very dream of a
ʻnomad scienceʼ (or of scientific progress in the field of
linguistic pragmatics) is given short shrift, it becomes
unclear what research (as opposed to philosophical
conceptualization or literary invention) this programme
may be up to. Though at one point Lecercle feebly
tries to convince us that Deleuze might be the sort
of social constructivist (read unreconstructed idealist)
for whom all phenomena are linguistically constituted,
there isnʼt actually any way to maintain the specificity
of language, disciplinary or otherwise, in a Deleuzean
framework, especially once the structuralist project of
the Logic of Sense, and its concept of static genesis,
are supplanted by the logic of assemblage of the
works with Guattari – a passage that Lecercle himself
navigates with considerable pedagogical flair. Even
when it comes to the supposedly radical creativity of
artistic uses of language, the continuum of variations
or plane of consistency that allegedly emerges from the
flight from linguistic constants is precisely not itself
of the order of language, as borne out by Deleuze
and Guattariʼs discussion of vocalization in the works
of Luciano Berio and by their general penchant for
synaesthetic experiences.
The famous body without organs is built, amongst
other things, on the expulsion of the organ of language.
And it is really here – rather than in the interesting
juxtaposition of models of science and formalization,
and even less in the risible notion that Chomskyan linguistics
is to the ʻrightʼ of an emancipatory Deleuzean
philosophy of literature (how one can be an anarcho-syndicalist
and a state philosopher is beyond this
reviewer) – that the crux of the polemical confrontation
lies. The fundamental ʻnaturalistʼ tenet that lies
behind Chomskyʼs programme (as well as a number of
competing approaches to language) has been succinctly
stated by the Italian philosopher Franco Lo Piparo,
in his recent work Aristotele e il linguaggio: ʻMen
do not use language, they live language. Language is
not a tool, but rather the species-specific activity of
natural organs.ʼ All of Deleuzeʼs approach is negatively
determined by a systematic or transcendental opposition
to any such thesis. Philosophical anti-humanism
may generalize the category of language to cover
all semiotic phenomena (as in the vulgar image of
structuralism attacked by Lecercle) or extend that of
the sign to pervade the entire ontology of relations (as
in Deleuzeʼs neo-vitalism), but it cannot abdicate on its
opposition to the notion of a species-specific capacity
that would be binding on philosophical reflection and
formalization.
Recalling the problems left pending in Chomskyʼs
notorious 1971 debate with Michel Foucault, we should
note that this decision on human nature resonates
with questions of political justice, equality and action,
albeit in a manner that is by no means univocal or
predictable. Recursively applying the method of the
problem to Lecercleʼs own work – and, in turn, to
Deleuzeʼs – we could say that both are driven by a
systematic disavowal of both the problem of human
nature (and the biological specificity of the capacity
for language) and of political decision (and the
existence of a determinate and perhaps even autonomous
domain for transformative collective practice).
Recasting Deleuzeʼs problem of language in this light
can make us sensitive to what remains attractive and
profoundly consistent in his opposition to both mathesis
universalis and naturalism (the two pillars of the
Chomskyan line); it can also locate a far richer ground
on which to pose the delicate (and perhaps ultimately
undecidable) question of the political significance of
these disputes. Whilst Lecercle has provided us with
a strong case for taking Deleuzeʼs literary experimentalism,
his political anti-humanism and his semiologic
of the assemblage as a coherent constellation
(as well as with a non-Deleuzean demonstration of
how to philosophize within the sentence), he has, in
the polemical staging of this supposed programme,
and emulating one of the least attractive of Deleuzeʼs
rhetorical habits, sunk to attacking his rival on the
basis of an entirely nebulous and ultimately dishonest
notion of political domination. Lecercleʼs Chomsky is
very much like Deleuzeʼs Hegel, an enemy cut to size
that bears little resemblance to the thinker with whom
he shares a proper name.
To argue, on the basis of no evidence whatsoever,
that (Chomskyan) linguistics is ʻpart of the ideological
structure of capitalismʼ is the kind of grandiloquent
statement that does the author no favours, not least
because Deleuzeʼs concept of language is supposed
to have supplanted both structure and ideology. Is it
not time that this genre of rhetoric be left behind,
lest we end up waxing deliriously on the deep political
urgency of the struggle between the Deleuzeanʼs
ʻcrowned anarchyʼ and the linguistʼs ʻdemocracy of
corpusʼ? (At a pre-theoretical level, one could maliciously
observe that a Deleuzean vocabulary, suitably
decontextualized, is far more consonant with
the exploitative nomadism of todayʼs finance capitalism
than Chomskyʼs essentially ahistorical speaking
subject.) Then the very serious issues brought up in
this work can be approached with the rigour they
deserve. This involves recasting the problem in terms
of an opposition between, on the one hand, a view of
language founded on the natural and universal possession
of a capacity, or ʻlanguage facultyʼ, and, on the
other, one which dissolves language in the construction
of a continuum of creative variations, on the basis of
an ontology of univocity. Whoever chooses to undertake
this task will arguably have to forgo recourse to
the non-dialectical method of the correlation (simply
opposing the two projects term by term) and bear in
mind, amongst other things, that Chomsky is a philosopher
of ubiquitous or non-extraordinary creativity
and Deleuze one of the few contemporary thinkers to
have resurrected Kantʼs theory of the faculties.
Lecercle has provided us with a detailed and combative
defence of the Deleuzean (or rather, Deleuzo-Guattarian)
project, but many of the problems generated in
this important book will only be adequately confronted
once the intersection of language, (anti-)naturalism
and politics is approached in its own right as an
object of systematic inquiry. This might mean leaving
behind the image of the assembly line that graces
this volumeʼs cover, and envisioning what happens
to politics (and to the very transformations in our
modes of production – whether material, immaterial
or literary) when language is no longer cast as a tool;
when it becomes the privileged site for a renewed
conceptualization of a generic human capacity for
thought and action.

## Kate Dorney

 In Deleuze and Language, Lecercle undertakes the complex task of tracing (to use a
 suitably cartographic metaphor) Gilles Deleuze’s philosophy of language. Here and in
 earlier works Lecercle has noted that, unlike many other philosophical engagements with
 language, Deleuze’s work has tended to confront language in all its messy materiality
 rather than reducing it to a convenient system of explication (Lecercle, 1985, 1990).
 Lecercle approaches Deleuze’s ‘philosophy of language’ in a suitably Deleuzean manner:
 rhizomatic rather than structural; favouring the correlation over the equation; and seeking
 not to impose order or to demonstrate a cohesive thesis, but to map, illustrate, and attempt
 to apply Deleuze’s attitudes to language through a series of literary ‘interludes’. ‘Rhizome’
 is defined by the OED as ‘an underground rootlike stem bearing both roots and shoots’. In
 Deleuze (and Guattari) the ‘rhizome’ is introduced as an alternative means of ordering to
 the tree of Porphyry. Porphyry has a fixed horizontal order, a rhizome is an untidy and
 unfixable network – a much more suitable model for expressing the fluid, untidy and – in
 Deleuze’s opinion – insidious behaviour of language.
 Deleuze and Language situates itself within the debate surrounding the linguistics
 and/or philosophy interface. While acknowledging that linguistics and philosophy are often
 mutually influential, Lecercle sticks to distinguishing between ‘linguists/linguistics’ and
 ‘philosophers/philosophy’ as he delineates the problem of language in Deleuze’s work, or,
 perhaps more accurately, Deleuze’s problem with language. The problem is ‘the
 imperialism of language’, i.e. the dominance of language over other structures of meaning.
 As Lecercle notes, ‘contemporary philosophy is said to have taken a linguistic turn several
 decades ago’, and Deleuze turned resolutely in the opposite direction, intent on demoting
 language from its pole position on the structuralist starting grid (p. 247). This (anti)
linguistic turn is motivated by the desire to return philosophy to the study of thought rather
 than the study of language:
 Deleuze’s aim is to put language in its place, in all the senses of the word. In Deleuze,
 language is generally, and systematically, demoted: the focus of his philosophy is on
 thought (which is not assimilated to language – nor is it a form of ‘mentalese’, as with
 cognitive scientists), on intensity and speed, on a geography of planes and strata. (p.
 248)
 As Lecercle so acerbically points out, for Deleuze ‘the idea that all philosophical problems
 might be grammatical problems is anathema’ (p. 21). It is hard not to be sympathetic to
 such a view: as (Continental) philosophy has become increasingly co-opted into literary
 theory and pragmatics, such a backlash seemed inevitable. Roy Harris’s work in
 philosophy and linguistics (1981) has consistently reminded us of the overlaps and
 borrowings between the two disciplines, but it has also made us aware of the extent to
 which philosophy has contributed to the ‘language myth’, i.e. the idea of language as an
 unproblematic channel of communication. Lecercle’s work on Deleuze here and in The
 Violence of Language (1990) takes issue with other ideas that spring from this language
 myth, namely that communication is (a) the goal of language, and (b) easily achieved via
 Grice’s cooperative principles. Deleuze and Language takes Deleuze’s (apparent) hostility
 towards language – metaphor in particular – and describes an alternative view of language
 and its place in the world.
 Lecercle begins by comparing the attitudes to language of Beckett and Deleuze, arguing
 that both have often been misunderstood as representing language in a(n) (in)terminable
 (or so it seems to those of us who endure paper after paper describing Beckett’s
 encapsulation of language in its death throes) state of decay and death. Instead, Lecercle
 advances the idea that both Beckett and Deleuze – in his engagement with Beckett and the
 high modernist writers – are interested in exploring the tensions and hostilities between the
 philosophical problem with language (which I will gloss as whether or not language can
 express truth) and the literary problem with language (whether language can express us).
 Lecercle takes as his ‘parable’ for this section ‘L’épuisé’ – Deleuze’s commentary on
 Beckett’s late television plays:
 The opportunity this ‘text’ gives Deleuze is that of a reflection on the limitations of
 language, and the theorisation of the consequent hostility to language. This is a familiar
 thread throughout the philosophical and religious traditions: language betrays thought,
 it is incapable of reproducing the emergence of the event, ekphrasis is a sorry substitute
 for the immediacy of the picture. Language does not, contrary to appearances and to its
 explicit function, foster the emergence and the circulation of meaning: it freezes into
 common sense; it betrays the violence of the event in articulate discourse. And yet this
 pessimistic view of language is, at the same time, a paean to the necessity of literature,
 the art of language, which can capture and welcome the event, by pushing language to
 its limits, on that frontier where it meets other media. For there is a form of language,
 the language of poetry, that can, if it abandons ‘le vieux style’, accommodate vision and
 music. There is, however, a condition to be fulfilled: such language must be as a foreign
 tongue within the material idiom – language, but strange and out of kilter. Deleuze has a
 phrase to describe this, which is also Beckett’s ‘non-style’, his rejection of any attempt
 at writing: such language is ‘mal vu mal dit’. (pp. 6–7)
 Lecercle rejects the notion that ‘non-style’ is just another attempt to bring about a
 revolution in poetic language; instead he sees it as ‘the symptom of the philosophical
 problem, of the problem of language, in its two, paradoxical aspects of the philosopher’s
 necessary resistance and hostility to, but also obsession with, language’ (p. 7). ‘Style’ is a
 vital concept in the Deleuzean engagement with language, described by Lecercle as ‘the
 concept that Deleuze constructs to name and explicate a problem of language’ (p. 256), and
 thus not only not confined to the literary text, but almost more pertinent to, and for, the
 philosopher. Lecercle reviews this problem of ‘style’ in a brief survey of the history of
 misunderstandings and wilful ‘misprisions’ that characterize philosophy’s attempts to
 engage with linguistics and language, including, inevitably, the debate between Derrida
 and Searle encapsulated in Limited Inc (1984). As mentioned above, the literary writer’s
 obsession with language is also considered, and not just in the cases of the oft-quoted (on
 matters of linguistic moribundity) Beckett and Joyce, but in the cases of Kipling and
 Dickens as well.
 Taking liberties with language, it is suggested, is a political act as well as a creative one.
 From the variety of strategies Deleuze suggests to combat the ‘imperialism of language’,
 and to destabilize its privileged position, disrupting linguistic norms, or making language
 ‘stutter’, is a particularly pertinent one for stylisticians and practitioners of CDA (p. 23).
 ‘Stuttering’ pushes language out of its habitual uses and ‘create[s] extraordinary words for
 the most ordinary uses’ (p. 26). Its purpose is to dislodge the hegemonic hold of standard
 languages, and to problematize those myths about language which make it seem a purely
 consensual and cooperative process, rather than ‘the site of conflict, a conflict waged in
 and among signifiers, a conflict of voices and discourses, the result of which is the
 stuttering of language’ (p. 138). Through the application of Deleuze’s theories to literary
 texts in the ‘interludes’, Lecercle provides another perspective for interpreting texts from
 any literary period, a perspective that is as open-ended and versatile as the most
 postmodern text.
 The book is not for the reader who finds Deleuze difficult to grasp – it is an
 application/exploration of his philosophy rather than a simplistic or reductive explanation
 of it. Lecercle presupposes substantial amounts of philosophical and linguistic knowledge
 in order to do justice to the awesome complexity of Deleuze’s own oeuvre and polymathic
 tendencies. As Lecercle himself acknowledges, ‘Deleuze’s highly technical philosophical
 discourse’ is notoriously difficult to follow, and it has taken him 30 years to fully
 understand and articulate the theories laid out in this text (p. 133). The book seems, to a
 certain extent, to mirror Deleuze’s favourite philosophical ‘tools’. For example, following
 his explanation of Deleuze’s rejection of the Hegelian dialectic in favour of the ‘open
ended’ and ‘anarchic’ (p. 16) correlation, Lecercle subsequently dismisses his thesis about
 the exclusion of language from the machine of Anti-Oedipus as an instance of Freudian
 denial as ‘too facile, it smacks of the psychoanalyst’s customary trick’ (p. 19). ‘Open
ended-ness’ and anarchy pervade the text; what is given as a certainty in one paragraph
 may be challenged, ridiculed, or disavowed in the next. Lecercle’s summary ‘given in a
 number of contradictory theses’ suggests the challenging, but fascinating scope, both of
 this text and of Deleuze’s oeuvre (p. 254).
 1. Immanence, not transcendence.
 2. Becoming, not structure.
 3. Force, not signification.
 4. Speed, not stasis.
 5. Variations, not positions.
 6. Rhizomes, not tree-like hierarchies.
 7. Lines and planes, not depth v. surface.
 8. History, not synchrony.
 9. External, not internal.
 10. Creativity, not rules.
 11. Maxims, not laws.
 12. Assemblages, neither subjects nor system.
 13. Minority, neither standard nor major language.
 14. Slogans, not propositions.
 15. Literature, not a democracy of corpuses.
 16. Agrammaticality, not acceptability and syntax as power. (p. 255)

 Deleuze and Language is a challenging and thoroughly rewarding book,
 fastidiously detailed in its analyses and clarifications of a complex,
 coherently undocumented dimension of the Deleuzean corpus. Like
 John Locke before them, neither Deleuze, nor the critical collaboration
 of Deleuze and Guattari, produced a coherent theory of language; despite
 offering theories of meaning, poetic language, style and pragmatics, they
 left no book entitled What is Language? Yet comments on language
 abound in Deleuze’s writings. The most sustained discussion occurs in
 his early book Logique du Sens, and in the ‘Postulates of linguistics’
 section of Mille Plateaux where a negative theorizing of language by
 way of a critique of linguistics occupies a prominent place. It is Lecercle’s
 great achievement to have gathered together these scattered statements
 into the closest document to date that might be called a Deleuzean
 theory of language. In an authentic sense Deleuze and Language is the
 book on language Deleuze never wrote.1 How Deleuzean concepts of
 language inform Lecercle’s own previous linguistic reflections is beyond
 the scope of this review. Suffice it to say that the author comes as no
 stranger to his subject. There are lengthy discussions of Deleuze
 and Guattari in Philosophy Through the Looking Glass (1985) and The
 Violence of Language (1990) as well as briefer discussions in both his
 Philosophy of Nonsense (1994) and Interpretation as Pragmatics (1999).
 An in-depth study, indeed a broad construction of Deleuze’s philosophy
 of language, is a natural extension of Lecercle’s other published studies
 on délire, nonsense, and the remainder. (There is an intimate conjunction
 of a language founded on assemblage to dreams and nonsense.) Given
 these common interests we might expect Lecercle to be naturally
 sympathetic to Deleuzean provocations, but Deleuze and Language is
 no mere accolade and Lecercle does not hold back from critical comments.
 He tenders a candid assessment of Deleuze’s elitism and is alert
 to problematic formulations, noting Deleuze’s tendency to selective
 idiosyncratic reading and, in one specific case, an appropriation and
 misreading of Benveniste’s enunciation linguistics. In Chapter 1, though
 not uncharitable to Deleuze, he unfolds a certain inconsistency and
 comes close to endorsing Derrida’s claim in ‘White mythology’ to the
 ineluctable presence of metaphor in philosophical discourse. (Deleuze,
 while antipathetic to metaphor, justifies his rejection by appeal to the
 metaphor of stammering.)
 Lecercle’s project, announced in the first chapter, is to show that
 language is a problem for Deleuze, but the ‘problem provides a guiding
 thread through the whole of Deleuze’s philosophy’ (p. 36). An ambitious
 project, no doubt, which aims ‘to treat Deleuze as he treated Spinoza or
 Leibniz, to claim that in his work language is what he claims expression is
 in Spinoza or the fold in Leibniz’ (p. 37). This desire to read Deleuze as
 Deleuze would read others entails a bold imperative: to create a concept
 adequate to the problem; specifically a Lecerclean concept adequate to the
 problem of Deleuzean language. However, if language is a problem for
 Deleuze it is a problem not to be solved but conceptualized, and the
 concept offered is the paradox that constructs and is established among a
 proliferation of part-theories that Deleuze provides.
 A persistent provocation throughout the book is Lecercle’s initial entry
 into Deleuzean language through Samuel Beckett, the exemplary writer of
 linguistic exhaustion. Indeed, Deleuze adopts a catechretic if not paradoxical
 stance towards language. On the one hand, as the heir of Bergson,
 Deleuze adopts a profound distrust of language, on the other an obsession
 with it. This paradoxical obsession with and distrust of language, Lecercle
 insists, is a central theme in Deleuze’s thought. The latter’s philosophy of
 language, Lecercle argues, has a centrifugal dynamic along a series of
 negatively articulated correlations: function not representation, body not
 logos, cuts not signs, intensities not significations, assemblages not subjects,
 force not information. Such correlations imply paradoxically ‘a strategy of
 displacing language from its centrality in the culture of structuralism, of
 re-inscribing it in its material site of emergence, the body’ (p. 18) by which
 language is both demoted and reinstated.
 In large part Deleuze and Language obtains its clarity through adopting
 Deleuze’s own method of correlation as the preferred discursive tool. (The
 correlation occurs in Deleuze under the names of synthesis or ‘series’.) By
 means of provocative correlational groupings, Lecercle successfully unpacks
 a rich cornucopia of Deleuzean concepts: truth as interest, force, event,
 style and sense. Beyond the familiar concepts (rhizome, plane of consistency,
 singularity) the book advances exegesis of lesser known ones. (I note
 especially the astute comparison of Deleuze’s notion of event with the
 Lacanian informed versions of Badiou and Žižek.)
 Moreover, Lecercle is exhaustive in his methods and detailed interpretations
 (devoting, for example, five and a half pages to an analysis of the
 opening sentence of Joyce’s story ‘The Dead’) and approaches his subject
 as literary theorist, linguist and philosopher. (Neither Deleuze nor Guattari
 were linguists.) In addition, Lecercle supplements his exposition with an
 invigorating variety of examples from Sherlock Holmes to Rudyard Kipling,
 through Canetti to Graham Swift’s Ever After. His skilful negotiation
 between the three discourses is no mean accomplishment per se, but more
 importantly it situates literature and philosophy in a rich manifold. In his
 philosophic sorties Lecercle never leaves literature, insisting throughout on
 the intrinsic relevance of Deleuze’s language to literary text production.
 Indeed, detectable within Deleuze’s theory of language is a theory of
 literature whose mandate Lecercle makes clear. ‘The Deleuzean event, being
 so clearly involved with language, enables us to decide that the highest task
 of literature is not to represent the event, to re-enact or reproduce in
 memory the flash or illumination of the encounter with the Lacanian Real,
 but to be the event of language, far more than with the event in language’
 (p. 130).
 Chapter 2 unthreads Deleuze’s paradoxical stance towards linguistics.
 On the one hand there is a manifest hostility to Chomsky, Saussure, the
 bi-univocity of the sign, on the other a patent reliance on different
 linguists (Hjelmslev, Labov and Benveniste) to provide the terminological
 ammunition to construct his own proposals. Such a paradox is not damning
 but tellingly proves that Deleuze’s stance is categorically suspect. Chapter
 3 outlines Deleuze’s theory of linguistic genesis through a necessarily
 fastidious methodological reading of Logique du Sens and its little-known
 ur-text ‘A quoi reconnaît-on le structuralisme?’. The sense emerges of
 Deleuze’s concept of language being formulated across a series of adversarial
 positions: anti-metaphorical, counter-representational, anti-linguistic,
 counter-formalist and counter-hermeneutic (not surprisingly, Chomsky
 and Saussure are Deleuze’s prime targets). At the same time there emerges
 a picture of Deleuze as more an appropriator and developer than an original
 thinker. The philosopher’s debts and derivations accumulate: Bergson,
 the Stoics, Hjelmslev (for plane and strata), Nietszche (for force) and
 Voloshinov (for the ineluctably indirect nature of discourse and the slogan
 as constituting the basic element of utterance). Predictable genealogies
 appear: the Stoics, Democritus, Lewis Carroll, Artaud, for instance, comprise
 the ‘dark face of the dominant’. (In places too Lecercle uncovers
 surprising alliances; for instance, Deleuze’s ‘Hegelian’ notion of philosophy’s
 task.)
 Lecercle’s detailed study and assemblage not only provides a fecund
 opportunity to revisit the Deleuze and Guattari corpus and trace lines of
 linguistic theorizing, but also a pragmatic opportunity. To respond with an
 appropriately Deleuzean question one might ask: How can this book be
 used? Doubtless its practical value in the areas of poetics and architecture
 is enormous. The ‘Deleuzean turn’ in architecture occurred in 1993 with
 the publication of an issue of Art and Design guest-edited by Greg Lynn
 and devoted to folding in architecture, but this in turn remains partial and
 misleadingly synecdochal. Indeed, it may be taken as a point of irony in
 architectural practice, historically concerned with a constant critique of its
 codes, that the impact of Deleuze has registered largely in the form of a
 solitary concept: the fold.2 The notable exception is Bernard Cache (a
 Paris-based architect, designer and former student of Deleuze) whose
 thinking marks a major shift from the problematics of representation to
 that of space and movement. Moreover, Cache’s theory of the image offers
 a rich potential within contemporary poetics. Cachean ‘images’ are analysed
 as territories and frames, not as mimetic models, figuration, and so on.
 This helps to take architecture out of architectonics and position it within
 the issues of potentialities and of dynamics ‘prior to the representation of
 stable objects’. Following Deleuze, Cache conceives the image as interstitial,
 involving ‘what transpires in the intervals or disparities between things’.3
 Such an image occurs pre-eminently within dynamically unstable conditions
 and milieux. Accordingly, images are not pictorial representations but
 rather dynamics of pre-presentation.
 A parallel impact on contemporary poetics awaits to be traced.
 Deleuze’s advocacy of high modernist aspirations is well known and, despite
 Lecercle’s attempts to broaden the cultural base of Deleuze’s linguistic
 predilections, the book still seems to endorse that recovery of a modernist
 avant-garde advanced by much continental theory (Lyotard, Kristeva,
 Eco and Deleuze and Guattari). Surprisingly, Lecercle fails to make the
 important link of Deleuze’s call to ungrammaticality and syntactic disruption
 to Heidegger’s reflection in the Letter on Humanism. ‘Metaphysics,
 which, very early in the form of Occidental ‘‘logic’’ and ‘‘grammar’’ seized
 control of the interpretation of language. We today can only begin to
 descry what is concealed in that occurrence. The liberation of language
 from grammar into a more original essential framework is reserved for
 thought and poetic creation.’4
 The proximity of poet and philosopher was apparent to Deleuze
 both seek to stutter in their dominant language, thereby causing language
 to stammer– and as Lecercle informs us, ‘The new pragmatics is, at the
 same time and indissolubly, a new poetics’ (p. 199). Lecercle detects two
 latent poetics in Deleuze’s thinking (what I will risk naming a Deleuzo-Foucaultian
 and a Deleuzo-Guattarian); the former advocating those
 linguistic disruptions, deviations and subversions characteristic of ‘high
 modernism’ (referred to by Lecercle as a ‘now faded avant-garde’); the latter
 a quasi-Marxist poetics of machines and assemblages, closer to the linguistics
 of Nicholas Marr than Joseph Stalin, and presupposing the inherent
 politicality of all utterances.5 At the centre of Deleuze and Guattari’s
 philosophy of language is the ‘rule-breaking creativity of texts’, and contemporary
 poetics should embrace this book as a groundbreaking extension
 into and across a complex philosophical discourse. Beyond the book’s
 intrinsic contribution to Deleuzean studies, Deleuze and Language implicitly
 offers a potential poetics that itself involves the restitution of certain
 avant-gardist aspirations; a poetics based on metamorphosis not metaphor;
 a non-signifying, non-representational, a-subjective poetics of collective
 assemblages. (Lecercle shies away from a full commitment to this when he
 discusses– in a reference comprehensible only to British readers– a more
 populist, non-literary form of linguistic deviance the ‘Coleman ball’.) With
 the move away from Saussure in some recent post-language writing it is
 Deleuze’s theory of language that potentially offers the most fecund
 apparatus for poetic exploitation, and in the light of this fact it is regrettable
 that Deleuze and Language is not yet available in an affordable paperback
 format.

 Notes
 1 Deleuze and Language offers a refreshing corrective to the bias in some contemporary
 ‘Deleuzean’ scholarship. In Chapter 1 Lecercle makes clear the identity
 behind the name ‘Deleuze’. ‘I have referred to the name ‘‘Deleuze’’ as denoting
 not an individual author but a collective assemblage of enunciation. Indeed, the
 texts I have used are sometimes signed by Deleuze alone, often by Deleuze and
 Guattari, or even by Deleuze and [Claire] Parnet. This passage from single
 author to assemblage is a philosophical gesture in the spirit of ‘‘Deleuze’’: a dual
 gesture, of position and of exclusion’ (p. 31). The title Deleuze and Language, as
 Lecercle readily admits, ‘is unfair to Guattari’, and an important section of
 Chapter 1 is devoted to detailing the latter’s four original contributions: the
 foundation of a new pragmatics, at the heart of which is a complex theory of
 ‘assemblages’; a plurality of semiotics; a semiotics of faciality (well worth
 comparison to Levinas’ different appropriation of the ‘face’), and a parallel
 semiotics of the ritournelles (jingles). I follow Lecercle in my use of the name
 Deleuze to refer to his collaborative endeavours with both Félix Guattari and
 Claire Parnet as well as to his own writings. Deleuze and Language is not a book
 about an individual, but that collective assemblage of enunciation referred to by
 the name of Gilles Deleuze. Hence, Claire Parnet and Félix Guattari are both
 noted presences. Indeed, the book’s seminal achievement is to open up Deleuzian
 scholarship to its collaborative nature: Kafka, A Thousand Plateaus, Anti Oedipus
 and What is Philosophy?
