# Holistic Review: CLI `acquire` Functionality (2025-05-03)

**Objective:** Conduct a holistic review of the CLI `acquire` command group (`src/philograph/cli/main.py`) and its associated tests (`tests/cli/test_cli_main.py`), focusing on quality, integration, documentation, error handling, and test coverage following recent stabilization.

**Files Reviewed:**
*   `src/philograph/cli/main.py` (Lines ~267-416)
*   `tests/cli/test_cli_main.py` (Lines ~703-1290, focusing on `acquire` and `status` tests)

**Review Findings:**

1.  **Code Quality & Clarity:**
    *   **`src/philograph/cli/main.py`:** The code quality for the `acquire` command and its helpers (`_display_confirmation_options`, `_handle_acquire_confirmation`) is good. Recent refactoring [Ref: GlobalContext 2025-05-02 14:53:35] successfully modularized the complex confirmation logic, improving readability and maintainability. Type hints and logging are used appropriately.
    *   **`tests/cli/test_cli_main.py`:** Tests generally use `pytest` and `unittest.mock` effectively. Test names are descriptive.

2.  **Integration Points:**
    *   **CLI <-> API:** Integration relies on the `make_api_request` helper, which centralizes calls to backend endpoints (`/acquire`, `/acquire/confirm`, `/acquire/status/{id}`) and handles common HTTP/connection errors. This is a good pattern.
    *   **Tests:** Mocks for API calls (`make_api_request`), user input (`typer.prompt`), and console output (`display_results`, `error_console`) are used appropriately to isolate the CLI logic under test.

3.  **Refactoring/Optimization:**
    *   **`src/philograph/cli/main.py`:** No immediate, major refactoring needs identified for the `acquire` code itself, thanks to the recent extraction of helper functions.
    *   **`tests/cli/test_cli_main.py`:** Some test redundancy exists, particularly around API error handling for the `acquire` command (e.g., `test_acquire_confirmation_api_error` appears twice, `test_acquire_api_error` and `test_acquire_initial_api_error` seem duplicative). These could be consolidated.

4.  **Documentation:**
    *   **Inline Comments:** Sufficient inline comments exist within `_handle_acquire_confirmation` following previous updates [Ref: GlobalContext 2025-05-02 14:59:29].
    *   **Docstrings:** Present for commands and helper functions.
    *   **README:** Updated previously [Ref: GlobalContext 2025-05-02 16:19:51].
    *   **Conclusion:** No immediate documentation gaps identified for the `acquire` functionality.

5.  **Error Handling:**
    *   **CLI Code:** Handles argument validation (e.g., mutually exclusive options) and delegates API error handling to `make_api_request`. The confirmation flow includes checks for invalid user input. Error reporting uses `error_console`. Overall, error handling appears robust.
    *   **Tests:** Cover various error scenarios including API errors (initial call, confirm call), invalid user input, and missing arguments.

6.  **TDD/Test Coverage:**
    *   **Overall:** Good test coverage for most `acquire` and `status` scenarios (success, confirmation flow, cancellation, threshold usage, API errors, status checks).
    *   **Critical Gap:** The test `test_acquire_confirmation_flow_yes_flag` remains skipped due to the previously identified intractable mocking issue [Ref: Holistic Reviewer Feedback 2025-05-02 13:01:39, Task HR-CLI-ACQ-01]. This means the core auto-confirmation logic (`--yes` flag with a single result) is **not currently verified by automated tests**.
    *   **Redundancy:** As noted in Refactoring/Optimization, some tests for `acquire` API error handling appear redundant.

**Summary & Recommendations:**

The `acquire` CLI functionality is generally well-implemented and tested following recent refactoring and bug fixes. The code structure is clear, and error handling is robust.

**Key Issues:**

1.  **Critical Test Gap (Skipped Test):** The skipped test `test_acquire_confirmation_flow_yes_flag` leaves the `--yes` auto-confirmation success path untested. This remains the most significant issue.
2.  **Test Redundancy:** Minor redundancy exists in `acquire` API error tests.

**Recommendations:**

1.  **Address Skipped Test (High Priority):** Re-evaluate the mocking strategy for `test_acquire_confirmation_flow_yes_flag`. Consider alternative approaches (e.g., different mocking libraries, refactoring the interaction slightly if necessary) to enable this critical test. Delegate to `debug` or `tdd` with a specific focus on resolving this blocker. *(No new task needed, refers back to the underlying issue of HR-CLI-ACQ-01)*
2.  **Consolidate Redundant Tests (Low Priority):** Refactor `tests/cli/test_cli_main.py` to remove duplicate tests for `acquire` API error handling (e.g., merge `test_acquire_api_error` / `test_acquire_initial_api_error`, remove duplicate `test_acquire_confirmation_api_error`). Delegate to `tdd`.

**Overall Status:** Stable, but the skipped test represents a notable risk that should be addressed.
