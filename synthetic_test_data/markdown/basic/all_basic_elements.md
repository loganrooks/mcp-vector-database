# Header 1: The Nature of Synthesis
This document serves as a basic test for Markdown parsing.
## Header 2: Elements of Style
We explore *italicized text* for emphasis, and **bold text** for strong importance. 
Sometimes, we might use `inline code` for technical terms or snippets.
### Header 3: Lists and Organization
An unordered list:
- Item Alpha: The first principle.
- Item Beta: The second consideration.
  - Nested Item Beta.1: A sub-point.
  - Nested Item Beta.2: Another sub-point.
- Item Gamma: The final thought in this list.
An ordered list:
1. First step: Define requirements.
2. Second step: Generate synthetic data.
   1. Sub-step 2.1: Create EPUBs.
   2. Sub-step 2.2: Create PDFs.
   3. Sub-step 2.3: Create Markdown files.
3. Third step: Test the system.
