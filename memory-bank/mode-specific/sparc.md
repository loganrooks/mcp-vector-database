# SPARC Orchestrator Specific Memory
<!-- Entries below should be added reverse chronologically (newest first) -->

### [2025-05-01 20:21:00] Intervention: SPARC Handover Received (New Instance - Context Limit)
- **Trigger**: `new_task` received from previous SPARC instance due to its context limit (57%).
- **Context**: Previous instance received Early Return from `debug` mode [Ref: Debug Early Return 2025-05-01 20:18:59] which resolved the CLI test mocking blocker in `tests/cli/test_cli_main.py` by asserting stdout.
- **Action Taken**: Initialized Memory Bank (activeContext, globalContext, sparc.md, sparc-feedback.md, tdd-feedback.md, debug-feedback.md). Reviewed handover context. Preparing to delegate TDD task for verification and continuation.
- **Rationale**: Adherence to `DELEGATE CLAUSE` by previous instance. Continuing workflow post-blocker resolution.
- **Outcome**: Handover accepted. Ready to delegate TDD task.
- **Follow-up**: Delegate TDD task as per handover instructions. Monitor context.
### [2025-05-01 19:55:48] Intervention: SPARC Handover (DELEGATE CLAUSE - Context Limit 68%)
- **Trigger**: SPARC Self-Monitoring - Context Limit Exceeded (68%).
- **Context**: Received Early Return from `tdd` mode [Ref: TDD Feedback 2025-05-01 19:54:41] due to intractable CLI test mocking blocker. Context size exceeds threshold.
- **Action Taken**: Updated delegation log for the failed `tdd` task. Preparing handover message for new SPARC instance via `new_task`.
- **Rationale**: Adherence to `DELEGATE CLAUSE` in `general.context_management` rules to prevent performance degradation.
- **Outcome**: Handover initiated.
- **Follow-up**: New SPARC instance to resume orchestration based on handover message, focusing on the CLI test mocking blocker.
### [2025-05-01 13:34:16] Intervention: SPARC Handover (DELEGATE CLAUSE - Previous Instance Context Limit)
- **Trigger**: `new_task` received from previous SPARC instance.
- **Context**: Previous SPARC instance reached context limit (reported 98%) after Debug mode resolved DB connection issue [Ref: Issue-ID: PYTEST-SIGKILL-DB-CONN-20250430]. Handover initiated to continue workflow.
- **Action Taken**: Initialized Memory Bank (activeContext, globalContext, sparc.md, sparc-feedback.md). Reviewed handover context. Preparing to delegate TDD task.
- **Rationale**: Adherence to `DELEGATE CLAUSE` by previous instance. Continuing workflow.
- **Outcome**: Handover accepted. Ready to delegate TDD task.
- **Follow-up**: Delegate TDD task as per handover instructions. Monitor context.

### [2025-05-01 19:57:10] Intervention: SPARC Handover (New Instance - Context Limit)
- **Trigger**: `new_task` received from previous SPARC instance due to its context limit (68%).
- **Context**: Previous instance received Early Return from `tdd` mode [Ref: TDD Feedback 2025-05-01 19:54:41] reporting intractable CLI test mocking blocker in `tests/cli/test_cli_main.py`.
- **Action Taken**: Initialized Memory Bank (activeContext, globalContext, sparc.md, tdd-feedback.md, debug-feedback.md). Reviewed handover context. Preparing to delegate Debug task.
- **Rationale**: Adherence to `DELEGATE CLAUSE` by previous instance. Continuing workflow to address the identified blocker.

- Expected deliverable: Completed tests for specified CLI commands in `tests/cli/test_main.py`.
- Status: failed (Early Return - Context 50%)
- Completion time: [2025-04-29 04:28:25]

- Status: failed (Early Return)
- Completion time: 2025-05-01 13:37:09
- Outcome: Early Return invoked. Regression test failed: 244 passed, 3 failed, 1 skipped. Failures due to persistent API 500 error on `/search` endpoint (`{"detail":"Search failed due to unexpected embedding error"}`) [Ref: Issue-ID: CLI-API-500-ERRORS]. DB connection fix confirmed.

- Expected deliverable: Fixed tests or clear diagnosis.
- Status: completed (via Early Return - Context 46.8%)
- Completion time: 2025-05-01 20:18:59
- Outcome: Resolved blocker by changing test strategy in `tests/cli/test_cli_main.py` to assert `result.stdout` instead of mocking output functions (`display_results`, `console.print`). Mocking `make_api_request` and asserting `result.exit_code == 1` for error cases remains valid. [Ref: Debug Early Return 2025-05-01 20:18:59]
- Link to Progress Entry: [See globalContext.md entry 2025-05-01 20:18:59]

- Assigned to: tdd
- Description: Verify fix in `tests/cli/test_cli_main.py` (assert stdout) and resume TDD for CLI module, starting after `status` command tests [Ref: TDD Feedback 2025-04-29 04:48:59].
- Expected deliverable: Verified fix, completed TDD cycles for next CLI commands (e.g., acquire), updated tests, passing test suite for CLI.
- Status: completed (Externally by User/Agent)
- Completion time: 2025-05-01 20:49:39 (Approx.)
- Outcome: Verified CLI test fix. Completed TDD cycles for `acquire-missing-texts` command. Refactored `acquire` and `acquire-missing-texts` into a single `acquire` command with `--find-missing-threshold` option. Updated tests. All 45 tests in `tests/cli/test_cli_main.py` pass.
- Link to Progress Entry: [See User Message 2025-05-01 20:49:39]
- Status: failed (Early Return)
- Completion time: 2025-05-01 15:44:43
- Outcome: Early Return invoked due to high context (75%) and syntax errors introduced in `src/philograph/search/service.py` while attempting to add logging. Investigation confirmed error linked to real GCP credentials but syntax errors prevent further verification/resolution. [See Debug Feedback 2025-05-01 15:43:00]

### [2025-05-01 22:11:49] Task: Resume TDD for Backend API (Stable)
- Assigned to: tdd
- Description: Continue TDD for API, starting with remaining `/search` or `/acquire` endpoints. [Ref: TDD Completion 2025-05-01 22:11:35]
- Expected deliverable: Completed TDD cycles for next API endpoints.
- Status: failed (Early Return - File Corruption #3)
- Completion time: 2025-05-01 22:28:10
- Outcome: Completed TDD cycles for `/acquire` service error, `GET /documents/{id}` invalid format, `/search` invalid limit/offset, `GET /collections/{id}` DB error. Blocked by recurring corruption (Pylance syntax errors, possible hidden chars) in `tests/api/test_main.py` when adding `test_get_document_references_db_error`. [Ref: TDD Feedback 2025-05-01 22:27:38]
- Link to Progress Entry: [See TDD Feedback 2025-05-01 22:27:38]
- Expected deliverable: Fixed code/config, verification via tests, updated `debug-feedback.md`.
- Status: failed (Early Return)
- Completion time: 2025-05-01 19:39:12
- Outcome: Early Return invoked due to context limit (47%) and shift in blocker. Fixed dimension mismatch via truncation workaround in `search/service.py` and fixed DB query formatting in `db_layer.py`. Backend errors resolved, but CLI tests (`tests/cli/test_cli_main.py::test_search_*`) now fail due to test suite issues (mocking/exit codes). [Ref: Debug Feedback 2025-05-01 19:37:24]
- Link to Progress Entry: [See activeContext.md entry 2025-05-01 19:37:24]
- Description: Resume TDD for `src/philograph/api/main.py` after Docker workaround. Verify env, test `/documents` 404, `/collections`, `/acquire`.
- Expected deliverable: Completed tests for specified endpoints.
- Status: failed (Early Return - Context 54%)
- Completion time: 2025-04-29 02:35:51
- Outcome: Fixed test env (`PYTHONPATH`, mock data). Verified `test_get_document_success`. Completed TDD for `/documents` 404, `/collections` success/validation. Added failing test for duplicate collection name. Returned early due to context.
### [2025-05-01 19:39:31] Task: Fix Failing CLI Search Tests
- Assigned to: tdd
- Description: Resolve failures in CLI search tests (`tests/cli/test_cli_main.py::test_search_*`) related to mocking/assertions after backend fixes.
- Expected deliverable: Fixed tests in `tests/cli/test_cli_main.py`, commit with fix, updated `tdd-feedback.md`.
- Status: failed (Early Return)
- Completion time: 2025-05-01 19:55:33
- Outcome: Early Return invoked due to context limit (47%) and intractable blocker. Unable to reliably mock `make_api_request` or assert `typer.Exit(1)` using `CliRunner`. Multiple strategies failed. [Ref: TDD Feedback 2025-05-01 19:54:41]

- Link to Progress Entry: [See globalContext.md entry 2025-04-29 02:35:51]
- Description: Resume TDD for `src/philograph/api/main.py`. Previous session blocked by Docker build issue (`COPY tests` failing) and context limit (~51%). Resume by debugging Dockerfile, verifying test execution in container, then continue testing API endpoints.
- Expected deliverable: Fixed Dockerfile, verified test execution, completed tests for `/search`, `/documents`, `/collections`, `/acquire`.
- Status: blocked
- Completion time: N/A
- Outcome: Early Return (Context ~51% & Docker Blocker). Blocked by Docker build issue: `COPY tests /app/tests` in `Dockerfile` fails to copy directory. Multiple fixes attempted unsuccessfully. [See TDD Feedback 2025-04-29 00:40:30]
