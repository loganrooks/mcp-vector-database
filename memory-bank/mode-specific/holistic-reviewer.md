### Delegated Task: HR-CLI-ACQ-02 - [2025-05-02 13:01:53]
- **Assigned To**: `tdd`
- **Related Finding**: Finding: Hygiene - [2025-05-02 13:01:04]
- **Task Description**: Remove obsolete skipped tests (`acquire-missing-texts`) and consolidate redundant `status` tests in `tests/cli/test_cli_main.py` *after* blocker resolution and refactoring.

### Delegated Task: HR-CLI-ACQ-01 - [2025-05-02 13:01:53]

- **Task Description**: Investigate and resolve persistent `TypeError` in `acquire` command tests (`test_acquire_confirmation_flow_yes_flag`, `test_acquire_missing_texts_auto_confirm_yes`) related to mocking/`CliRunner` interaction.
- **Status**: Completed [Ref: Debug Feedback 2025-05-02 13:09:30] - Blocker deemed intractable with current test setup. Problematic test re-skipped, obsolete test removed.

### Finding: Hygiene - [2025-05-03 14:07:25]
- **Category**: Hygiene
- **Location/File(s)**: `tests/cli/test_cli_main.py` (lines 815-856, 1211-1256, 904-924, 1257-1288)
- **Observation**: Some redundancy exists in tests covering API error handling for the `acquire` command. Specifically, `test_acquire_confirmation_api_error` appears duplicated, and `test_acquire_api_error` / `test_acquire_initial_api_error` seem to cover the same initial API call failure scenario.
- **Recommendation**: Consolidate redundant tests to improve maintainability. Delegate to `tdd` mode.
- **Severity/Priority**: Low
- **Delegated Task ID**: HR-CLI-ACQ-05 (To be created if delegation occurs)

### Finding: SPARC/TDD - [2025-05-03 14:07:25]
- **Category**: SPARC/TDD
- **Location/File(s)**: `tests/cli/test_cli_main.py` (line 771)
- **Observation**: The critical test `test_acquire_confirmation_flow_yes_flag`, which verifies the `--yes` auto-confirmation success path, remains skipped due to a previously identified intractable mocking issue [Ref: Task HR-CLI-ACQ-01, Debug Feedback 2025-05-02 13:09:30]. This leaves a significant gap in automated test coverage for core functionality.
- **Recommendation**: Re-prioritize resolving the mocking blocker for this test. Delegate to `debug` or `tdd` with a specific focus on finding a viable mocking strategy or necessary code adjustment to enable the test.
- **Severity/Priority**: High
- **Delegated Task ID**: (Relates to unresolved HR-CLI-ACQ-01)
## Review Findings & Recommendations
### Finding: Hygiene - [2025-05-02 13:01:04]
- **Category**: Hygiene
- **Location/File(s)**: `src/philograph/cli/main.py` (lines 334-337)
- **Observation**: Minor leftover comments ("Corrected from...") exist in the table creation logic within the `acquire` command's confirmation flow.
- **Recommendation**: Clean up these comments during refactoring.
- **Severity/Priority**: Low
- **Delegated Task ID**: HR-CLI-ACQ-03 (To be created)

### Finding: Documentation - [2025-05-02 13:01:04]
- **Category**: Documentation
- **Location/File(s)**: `src/philograph/cli/main.py` (lines 267-404)
- **Observation**: The complex confirmation flow logic within the `acquire` command lacks sufficient inline comments to explain the different states and decision points, particularly around the `--yes` flag handling.
- **Recommendation**: Add detailed inline comments to clarify the `acquire` confirmation flow.
- **Severity/Priority**: Medium
- **Delegated Task ID**: HR-CLI-ACQ-04 (To be created)

### Finding: Hygiene - [2025-05-02 13:01:04]
- **Category**: Hygiene
- **Location/File(s)**: `tests/cli/test_cli_main.py` (lines 1015-1103, 1149-1171)
- **Observation**: Several tests related to the old, merged `acquire-missing-texts` command are marked as skipped but remain in the file. Some redundancy also exists in `status` command tests.
- **Recommendation**: Remove obsolete skipped tests and consolidate redundant `status` tests after the primary refactoring and blocker resolution.
- **Severity/Priority**: Low
- **Delegated Task ID**: HR-CLI-ACQ-02 (To be created)

### Finding: SPARC/TDD - [2025-05-02 13:01:04]
- **Category**: SPARC/TDD
- **Location/File(s)**: `tests/cli/test_cli_main.py` (lines 767-814, 1173-1219)
- **Observation**: Critical tests for the `acquire` command's `--yes` auto-confirmation logic (`test_acquire_confirmation_flow_yes_flag`, `test_acquire_missing_texts_auto_confirm_yes`) are skipped due to a persistent, intractable `TypeError` related to mocking and `CliRunner` interaction [Ref: Debug Feedback 2025-05-02 05:28:06]. This represents a significant gap in test coverage for core functionality.
- **Recommendation**: Delegate investigation of the mocking/`CliRunner` `TypeError` to `debug` mode to unblock these tests.
- **Severity/Priority**: Critical
- **Delegated Task ID**: HR-CLI-ACQ-01 (To be created)

### Finding: Organization - [2025-05-02 13:01:04]
- **Category**: Organization
- **Location/File(s)**: `src/philograph/cli/main.py` (lines 267-404)
- **Observation**: The `acquire` command function is complex (~140 lines) and handles multiple responsibilities: argument validation, initial API call, and the multi-step confirmation flow (including `--yes` logic and user prompting). The code for displaying the confirmation options table is also duplicated.
- **Recommendation**: Refactor the `acquire` command. Extract the confirmation flow logic and the table display logic into separate helper functions to improve readability, maintainability, and reduce complexity.
- **Severity/Priority**: High
- **Delegated Task ID**: HR-CLI-ACQ-03 (To be created)
