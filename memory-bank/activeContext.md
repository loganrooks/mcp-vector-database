[Ref: Debug Feedback 2025-05-01 21:51:43]
[2025-05-01 21:45:17] - TDD - Early Return (File Corruption Blocker) - Invoked Early Return. Persistent syntax errors in `tests/api/test_main.py` after attempting to add `test_get_collection_db_error`. Multiple tool uses (`insert_content`, `apply_diff`) failed to resolve, suggesting file corruption. Recommending delegation to `debug`. [Ref: TDD Feedback 2025-05-01 21:44:52]
[2025-05-01 21:25:34] - TDD - API Test Cycles Completed (DELETE /collections/{id}) - Completed TDD cycles for DELETE /collections/{id} (success, not found). Tests passed against minimal implementation (placeholder db_layer function). Context at 38%. Invoking Early Return. [Ref: TDD Cycles 2025-05-01 21:24:02, 2025-05-01 21:25:34]

[2025-05-01 21:00:00] - TDD - Early Return (Syntax Blocker): Invoked Early Return. Persistent `SyntaxError` in `tests/api/test_main.py` after attempting to add `test_create_collection_db_error`. Multiple `apply_diff` attempts failed to resolve widespread syntax issues reported by Pylance and `pytest`. File appears corrupted. Recommending delegation to `debug` mode. [Ref: TDD Feedback 2025-05-01 21:00:00]
[2025-05-01 20:37:40] - TDD - Task Complete: Verified CLI test fix [Ref: GlobalContext 2025-05-01 20:17:00]. Resumed TDD for CLI module (`src/philograph/cli/main.py`). Completed TDD cycles for `acquire` command (initial call, confirmation flow, cancellation, auto-confirm, error handling). Refactored `acquire` command to consolidate logic and remove `acquire-missing-texts`. Verified all 45 tests in `tests/cli/test_cli_main.py` pass. Context: 35%.
[2025-05-01 20:19:00] - SPARC - Handover Triggered (DELEGATE CLAUSE - Context 57%) - Received Early Return from Debug mode [Ref: Debug Early Return 2025-05-01 20:18:59]. Debug resolved CLI test mocking blocker in `tests/cli/test_cli_main.py` by asserting stdout. SPARC context (57%) exceeds threshold. Preparing handover to new SPARC instance.
[2025-05-01 20:17:00] - Debug - Task Complete: Resolved CLI test mocking issues for `search` command in `tests/cli/test_cli_main.py`. Switched strategy from mocking output functions to asserting `result.stdout`. Verified passing tests. Context: 44.8%.
[2025-05-01 19:57:00] - SPARC - Handover Received (New Instance) - Taking over orchestration due to previous instance context limit (68%). Current blocker: Intractable CLI test mocking/runner issues in `tests/cli/test_cli_main.py` [Ref: TDD Feedback 2025-05-01 19:54:41]. Preparing to delegate to Debug mode.
[2025-05-01 19:37:24] - Debug - Early Return (Context 45% & Test Blocker): Invoking Early Return. Applied fixes for embedding dimension mismatch (truncation in `search/service.py`) and DB query parameterization (`db_layer.py`). Test failures shifted to CLI test suite issues (`make_api_request` mock not called / incorrect exit code assertion). Core backend bug [Ref: Issue-ID: CLI-API-500-ERRORS-DIMENSION] appears resolved, but CLI tests require debugging. Context at 45%. Recommending handover to TDD. [See Debug Feedback 2025-05-01 19:37:24]
[2025-05-01 15:47:14] - Code - Syntax Fix Completed - Corrected syntax errors (imports, indentation, try/except structure) in `src/philograph/search/service.py` introduced during previous debug session [Ref: Debug Feedback 2025-05-01 15:43:00]. File now parses correctly. Ready for commit and handover. [See Code Feedback 2025-05-01 15:46:53]
[2025-05-01 15:43:00] - Debug - Early Return (Context 74% & Syntax Error) - Invoking Early Return. Context limit reached after `insert_content` caused syntax errors in `src/philograph/search/service.py` while attempting to add logging. Blocker prevents fixing syntax and verifying GCP credential hypothesis for [Ref: Issue-ID: CLI-API-500-ERRORS]. [See Debug Feedback 2025-05-01 15:43:00]
[2025-05-01 13:36:45] - TDD - Regression Test Completed (Partial Success) - Ran full `pytest` suite post-DB fix [Ref: Issue-ID: PYTEST-SIGKILL-DB-CONN-20250430]. Result: 244 passed, 3 failed, 1 skipped. Failures isolated to CLI search tests (`test_search_*`) due to backend API 500 error: "Search failed due to unexpected embedding error". Confirms DB stability but highlights persistent embedding blocker [Ref: Issue-ID: CLI-API-500-ERRORS]. Invoking Early Return.
[2025-05-01 13:31:41] - Debug - Task Complete - Resolved persistent DB connection failure [Ref: Issue-ID: PYTEST-SIGKILL-DB-CONN-20250430]. Root cause: Unencoded special characters ('@') in DB_PASSWORD. Fix: Applied URL encoding (`urllib.parse.quote_plus`) in `src/philograph/config.py`. Verified via isolation test. Committed fix 537e2d7.
[2025-04-30 13:31:58] - Debug - Early Return (Intractable DB Blocker &amp; Context 43%) - Invoking Early Return. Persistent psycopg_pool connection failure ([Errno -2] Name or service not known / PoolTimeout) despite verified network connectivity (ping/nc ok), correct config (docker-compose, .env, config.py), and code adjustments (await pool.open(), IP address). Root cause likely subtle issue in psycopg/Python/Docker network interaction. Recommending deeper investigation. [Ref: Issue-ID: PYTEST-SIGKILL-DB-CONN-20250430]
[2025-04-30 13:01:03] - SPARC - TDD Early Return Received (DB Blocker) - Received Early Return from TDD [Ref: TDD Feedback 2025-04-30 12:47:14]. Verification of DB connection fix failed (`SIGKILL`). Persistent blocker: `philograph-backend` cannot connect to `db`. Delegating to Debug for network diagnostics. [Ref: Issue-ID: PYTEST-SIGKILL-DB-CONN-20250430]
[2025-04-30 07:31:51] - Debug - Early Return (Blocker &amp; Context 52%) - Persistent `SIGKILL`/`PoolTimeout` during `pytest` and direct Python execution in `philograph-backend`. Root cause: Failure to connect to 'db' service (hostname or IP) during `psycopg_pool` initialization, despite correct Docker networking/config. OS resolves hostname, but Python/psycopg fails. Delegating for deeper investigation. [Ref: Issue-ID: PYTEST-SIGKILL-DB-CONN-20250430] [See Debug Feedback 2025-04-30 07:31:51]
[2025-04-30 07:15:15] - TDD - Early Return (Blocker &amp; Context 41%) - Persistent SIGKILL during `pytest` execution in `philograph-backend` container, even after fixture scope change, 2GB memory limit increase, and running single test. Root cause likely excessive memory usage during FastAPI app initialization. Delegating to debug. [Ref: TDD Feedback 2025-04-30 07:15:15]
[2025-04-29 16:28:56] - SPARC - Configuration Complete & Resuming Debug - Corrected erroneous handover log. Docker services restarted successfully with updated .env (GCP credentials path, Project ID, Location). Delegating to TDD to run full test suite (`pytest`) and assess API status/regressions.
[2025-04-29 15:10:27] - DevOps - [Task Complete] - Managed Git debt by analyzing uncommitted changes and creating 5 logical commits: fix(infra), fix(core), fix(tests), docs(report), chore(memory). Working tree is clean.
[2025-04-29 11:31:18] - TDD - [Early Return] - Invoked Early Return. Regression check (`pytest`) after `/ingest` fix revealed 25 unexpected failures across API, Ingestion, Config, and CLI tests, indicating significant regressions or other issues. Documented in `tdd-feedback.md`. Recommending delegation to `debug`. [Ref: TDD Feedback 2025-04-29 11:30:13]
[2025-04-29 11:25:29] - Debug - Task Complete - Successfully fixed `/ingest` 404 handling. Verified API returns 404 for missing file via CLI test (`test_ingest_success` now fails with 404). Committed fix 0da0aea. [Ref: Issue-ID: CLI-API-500-ERRORS-INGEST]
[2025-04-29 10:14:20] - TDD - [Verification Failed &amp; Early Return] - Verified `/search` fix (credential error resolved, now fails as expected with embedding error). Failed to verify `/ingest` fix: API still returns 500 instead of expected 404 for non-existent file. Debug fix [Ref: Debug Feedback 2025-04-29 09:26:29] appears ineffective or reverted. Invoking Early Return. Recommending delegation to `debug` mode. Context: 40%.
[2025-04-29 09:40:03] - TDD - [Early Return] - Invoked Early Return immediately upon task resumption due to excessive context size (159%). Task was to verify backend API fixes and resume CLI TDD. Attempted `docker compose down &amp;&amp; docker compose up -d --build` before interruption. Handing back to SPARC.
[2025-04-29 09:25:27] - Debug - Early Return (Context 54%) - Applied fixes for `/search` (dummy GCP key in `.env`) and `/ingest` (404 error handling in `api/main.py`). Context limit exceeded before verification. Recommending handover for verification. [Ref: Debug Feedback 2025-04-29 09:25:27] [Ref: Issue-ID: CLI-API-500-ERRORS] [Ref: Issue-ID: CLI-API-500-ERRORS-INGEST]
[2025-04-29 09:18:53] - TDD - Verification &amp; Blocker - Ran `/ingest` CLI tests (`test_ingest_success`, `test_ingest_api_error`) after fixing invalid path in `tests/cli/test_main.py`. Tests failed with 500 Internal Server Error from backend API (`{"detail":"An unexpected error occurred during ingestion."}`). This confirms the path fix but reveals a new API-level blocker for `/ingest`, separate from the `/search` embedding error. CLI testing is blocked by backend API issues. [Ref: Issue-ID: CLI-API-500-ERRORS-INGEST]
[2025-04-29 05:07:42] - TDD - Verification &amp; Blocker - Ran specific `/search` CLI tests (`test_search_success_query_only`, `test_search_success_with_filters`, `test_search_api_error`). Tests failed with 500 Internal Server Error from backend API (`{"detail":"Embedding generation failed (HTTP 500)"}`). Crucially, the previous `ConnectError` is GONE, suggesting basic network connectivity to `litellm-proxy` is restored. New blocker is embedding generation failure within the API/proxy. Proceeding to fix known `/ingest` test path issue. [Ref: Debug Feedback 2025-04-29 05:03:55] [Ref: Issue-ID: CLI-API-500-ERRORS]
[2025-04-29 05:04:21] - Debug - Early Return (Context 62% & Blocker) - Invoking Early Return. Fixed `litellm-proxy` startup crash (YAML indentation error in `litellm_config.yaml`). Proxy logs confirm successful startup. However, unable to directly verify network connectivity from `philograph-backend` container due to missing `ping`/`curl`. Context limit exceeded. Recommending handover to TDD to run tests and check for `ConnectError`. [Ref: Debug Feedback 2025-04-29 05:03:55] [Ref: Issue-ID: CLI-API-500-ERRORS]
[2025-04-29 04:58:20] - Debug - Early Return (Context 66% & Blocker) - Invoking Early Return due to high context and persistent 500 errors on `/search` endpoint. Fixes for `docker-compose.yml` networking, `api/main.py` DB init, and `litellm_config.yaml` did not resolve the `litellm-proxy` connection issue (`Embedding generation failed (Request Error)`). Root cause likely still related to `litellm-proxy` service failing to start/run correctly. `/ingest` errors persist due to invalid test path. [Ref: Debug Feedback 2025-04-29 04:58:20]
[2025-04-29 04:36:45] - TDD - CLI Test Cycle (Red Passed) - Added test `test_acquire_missing_arguments`. Passed unexpectedly, confirming existing implementation handles missing --title/--author. Context: 48%. Invoking Early Return.
