[2025-04-28 17:06:27] - SPARC - Handover Triggered - Debug mode fixed test_call_grobid_extractor_api_request_error (commit d07e7f4). Context size (181%) exceeds threshold. Handing over to new SPARC instance. Next: Resume TDD for text_processing.py.
[2025-04-28 17:04:30] - Debug - Task Complete - Fixed `test_call_grobid_extractor_api_request_error` by correcting async mock `side_effect` and removing irrelevant assertions. Test passed. Committed fix (d07e7f4).
[2025-04-28 16:57:29] - SPARC - Task Status - TDD mode invoked Early Return due to persistent test failure (test_call_grobid_extractor_api_request_error). Delegating to Debug mode.
[2025-04-28 16:53:40] - TDD - Task Status - Test `test_call_grobid_extractor_api_request_error` failed again after attempting fix (Green phase). Exception handling for `httpx.RequestError` in `call_grobid_extractor` is not working as expected with mocks. Invoking Early Return due to persistent blocker and context limits. See `memory-bank/feedback/tdd-feedback.md` for details.
[2025-04-28 14:41:45] - TDD - Task Status - Test `test_call_grobid_extractor_api_success` passed unexpectedly on first run (Red phase). Implementation likely covers basic API success case. Proceeding to write next test for `call_grobid_extractor` (API error handling). Context: 45%.
[2025-04-28 14:36:45] - TDD - Task Status - Completed TDD cycle for `extract_epub_content` (basic success and read error handling). Tests passed after fixing assertions in `test_extract_epub_content_read_error`. No refactoring needed for tested paths. Proceeding with next test/function in `text_processing.py`.
[2025-04-28 14:32:30] - TDD - Task Status - Test `test_extract_epub_content_success` passed unexpectedly on first run (Red phase). Implementation likely covers basic case. Proceeding to write next test for `extract_epub_content` (e.g., error handling).
[2025-04-28 14:30:40] - TDD - Task Status - Verification PASSED for `test_get_db_pool_failure` when run in isolation (`pytest tests/data_access/test_db_layer.py::test_get_db_pool_failure`). Confirms user feedback regarding test interaction issue when running full file. Blocker resolved. Resuming original task: testing `src/philograph/utils/text_processing.py`. [Ref: Issue-ID: TDD-DBPOOL-FAIL-20250428]
[2025-04-28 14:27:30] - TDD - Task Status - Second verification attempt of db_layer fix FAILED. test_get_db_pool_failure still failing. Contradicts debug mode report [2025-04-28 13:24:10]. Invoking Early Return due to persistent blocker/contradiction. [Ref: Issue-ID: TDD-DBPOOL-FAIL-20250428]
[2025-04-28 13:24:10] - Debug - Task Status - Re-investigation of TDD-DBPOOL-FAIL-20250428 complete. Test test_get_db_pool_failure confirmed PASSING in current codebase. Discrepancy likely due to TDD verifying against older code state. No code changes made. [Ref: Issue-ID: TDD-DBPOOL-FAIL-20250428]
[2025-04-28 13:18:30] - TDD - Task Status - Verification of db_layer fix failed. test_get_db_pool_failure still failing. Contradicts previous reports. Delegating back to debug. [Ref: Issue-ID: TDD-DBPOOL-FAIL-20250428]
[2025-04-28 13:13:54] - SPARC - Task Status - Debug mode fixed test_get_db_pool_failure (commit e5dfc68). Resuming TDD task.
[2025-04-28 13:05:04] - Debug - Task Status - Successfully fixed `test_get_db_pool_failure` by mocking `cursor.execute` to raise `psycopg.OperationalError`. Test now passes. Preparing completion. [See Issue-ID: TDD-DBPOOL-FAIL-20250428]
[2025-04-28 13:01:37] - Debug - Task Status - Final attempt using custom AsyncContextManagerMock failed for `test_get_db_pool_failure`. Concluding diagnosis: Complex async/mock/psycopg interaction requires advanced testing techniques.
[2025-04-28 12:56:54] - Debug - Task Status - Debugging `test_get_db_pool_failure` concluded. Multiple mocking strategies failed to make the test pass. Diagnosis: Complex interaction between async/mocking/psycopg exception handling. Recommend further investigation into advanced async mocking.
[2025-04-28 12:26:14] - SPARC - Task Status - TDD mode invoked Early Return due to persistent test failure (test_get_db_pool_failure). Delegating to Debug mode.

[2025-04-28 09:54:06] - TDD - MCP Utils Cycle - Wrote tests for `call_mcp_tool` simulation in `tests/test_mcp_utils.py`. All 6 tests passed.
[2025-04-28 09:51:12] - TDD - HTTP Client Cycle - Wrote tests for `get_async_client`, `close_async_client`, and `make_async_request` (using `pytest-httpx` for mocking) in `tests/test_http_client.py`. Added `pytest-httpx` and `h2` (via `httpx[http2]`) to `requirements.txt` and installed. Fixed assertion in POST test to compare parsed JSON. All 12 tests passed.
[2025-04-28 09:41:34] - TDD - File Utils Cycle - Wrote tests for `check_file_exists`, `check_directory_exists`, `get_file_extension`, `join_paths`, `list_files_in_directory` in `tests/test_file_utils.py`. Fixed `NameError` in `src/philograph/utils/file_utils.py` by adding typing imports. All 23 tests passed.
[2025-04-28 09:34:12] - TDD - Config Helpers Cycle - Refactored `get_env_variable` in `src/philograph/config.py` to handle `default=None` correctly using sentinel. Added `pytest-dotenv` and `.env`. Added tests for `get_int_env_variable`, `get_bool_env_variable`, and `default=None` case. All 24 tests in `tests/test_config.py` passed.

[2025-04-27 23:25:52] - SpecPseudo - Task Update - Completed integration of hybrid LiteLLM + LangChain strategy into `docs/project-specifications.md` (now v2.3). LiteLLM confirmed as unified API gateway; LangChain planned for selective Tier 1+ introduction (LCEL, Chains, LangGraph) calling LiteLLM proxy. Updates applied via multiple `apply_diff` operations across all relevant sections.
[2025-04-27 22:12:50] - SpecPseudo - Task Update - Research Prompt Refinement: Revised the deep research prompt comparing LiteLLM and LangChain to explicitly include considerations for PhiloGraph Tiers 2, 3+, and speculative future extensions in the "Futurity" analysis, per user request.
