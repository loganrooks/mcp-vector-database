[2025-04-28 04:23:39] - Code - Task Update - Completed initial implementation of PhiloGraph Tier 0 MVP structure based on pseudocode and architecture docs (v2.3). Created core Python modules (config, data_access, utils, ingestion, search, acquisition, api, cli, mcp), Docker setup (Dockerfile, docker-compose.yml, litellm_config.yaml), requirements.txt, .env.example, .gitignore, and initial README.md. Ready for testing phase. Context size ~51%.
[2025-04-28 03:47:14] - SpecPseudo - Task Update - Generated Tier 0 pseudocode with TDD anchors for core components (DB Layer, Ingestion Pipeline, Backend API, Search Module, Text Acquisition, CLI, MCP Server) based on spec v2.3 and ADRs 001-008.

Updated architecture docs (main doc, ADR 004) and memory bank (global context, architect specific) to reflect recommended dimension of 768 for `text-embedding-large-exp-03-07` via MRL, pending empirical validation.
[2025-04-27 23:39:30] - Architect - Task Complete - Designed PhiloGraph Tier 0 MVP architecture based on spec v2.3. Created `docs/architecture/tier0_mvp_architecture.md` detailing components (Docker: Postgres+pgvector, LiteLLM Proxy, Python Backend, CPU Text Proc), workflows (Ingestion, Search via Vertex AI embeddings), and modularity for Tier 1 migration.
[2025-04-27 23:25:52] - SpecPseudo - Task Update - Completed integration of hybrid LiteLLM + LangChain strategy into `docs/project-specifications.md` (now v2.3). LiteLLM confirmed as unified API gateway; LangChain planned for selective Tier 1+ introduction (LCEL, Chains, LangGraph) calling LiteLLM proxy. Updates applied via multiple `apply_diff` operations across all relevant sections.
[2025-04-27 22:12:50] - SpecPseudo - Task Update - Research Prompt Refinement: Revised the deep research prompt comparing LiteLLM and LangChain to explicitly include considerations for PhiloGraph Tiers 2, 3+, and speculative future extensions in the "Futurity" analysis, per user request.
[2025-04-27 22:11:07] - SpecPseudo - Task Update - Research Prompt: Generated a detailed research prompt for the `vectorize` MCP server's `deep-research` tool to compare LiteLLM and LangChain in the context of the PhiloGraph specification (v2.2), focusing on scalability, maintainability, and futurity.
[2025-04-27 21:58:42] - SpecPseudo - Task Update & Re-Verification: Re-read `docs/project-specifications.md` after last diff. Performed comprehensive re-verification based on actual file content. Confirmed placeholders are intentional config vars, deferrals are explicit (what/why/when), and previously underdeveloped sections now have sufficient Tier 0 detail. Specification v2.2 is now considered complete and verified.

[2025-04-27 21:50:55] - SpecPseudo - Task Update - Final Corrections: Addressed persistent feedback by explicitly clarifying all "Deferred" items (Sections 6.2, 6.8, 6.9, 7.3) in `docs/project-specifications.md` with what/why/when details. Specification document v2.2 is now complete and addresses all known feedback.
[2025-04-27 21:44:57] - SpecPseudo - Task Update - Addressed user feedback: Replaced placeholders and added explicit details in Sections 8 (Phases 1-3), 9 (Brainstorming), 10.3 (Integrations), and 11 (Key Questions) of `docs/project-specifications.md`. Expanded mobile app concept further.

[2025-04-27 21:18:07] - SpecPseudo - Task Complete - Successfully revised docs/project-specifications.md (v2.2) based on user feedback and middleware report. Redefined Tier 0 MVP to use free cloud embeddings (Vertex AI via local LiteLLM Proxy) instead of local CPU embeddings, updating architecture, components, pipeline, and roadmap accordingly.
[2025-04-27 18:21:09] - SpecPseudo - Task Complete - Updated docs/project-specifications.md (v2.1) to define Tier 0 MVP (Local Laptop: Postgres+pgvector, Ollama CPU Embeddings, CPU Text Proc, Python Backend, CLI/MCP) based on synthesis report and task requirements. Emphasized migration path to Tier 1.
[2025-04-27 17:49:30] - SpecPseudo - Report Update - Added section analyzing migration paths and scalability between deployment tiers based on user feedback.
[2025-04-16 09:38:26] - SpecPseudo - Task Complete - Synthesized research findings into final report (docs/reports/philograph_synthesis_and_recommendations.md), covering MVP tiers, Gemini embeddings, cost optimization, note processing, UofT resources, DB migration, and other findings.


[2025-04-16 09:26:01] - SpecPseudo - Task Start - Synthesizing PhiloGraph research findings (v6 report + others) into final report (docs/reports/philograph_synthesis_and_recommendations.md).


[2025-04-16 01:36:22] - SpecPseudo - Action - Rewrote docs/project-specifications.md (v2.0) incorporating research findings (DB: ArangoDB, TextProc: GROBID/Kraken+mLLM/HybridChunking, Sources: DOAB/PhilPapers/OL+Anna's, Exec: Docker+MCP), added brainstorming, specified Gemini/Vertex AI embeddings for MVP.

[2025-04-15 04:10:44] - Code - Script Execution - Executed bash script to copy all *.md files in docs/philosophy/ and docs/classes/PHL316/ (and subdirectories) to corresponding *.txt files.

# Active Context - 2025-04-04 12:59:03
