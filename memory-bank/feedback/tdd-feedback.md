### [2025-04-28 09:56:23] - Early Return Invoked
- **Trigger**: User instruction during TDD cycle for `mcp_utils.py`.
- **Context**: Task was to implement unit/integration tests for `src/philograph/`. Tests for `config.py`, `utils/file_utils.py`, `utils/http_client.py`, and `utils/mcp_utils.py` were completed successfully. Dependencies (`pytest-dotenv`, `pytest-httpx`, `h2`) were added. Minor code fixes were applied (`file_utils.py` import, `test_http_client.py` assertion). Context size ~37%.
- **Action**: Halting TDD task as instructed.
- **Rationale**: User requested early return to address "poor version control practices and the git debt".
- **Outcome**: TDD task paused before testing `utils/text_processing.py`.
- **Follow-up**: Awaiting instructions or task delegation to address version control.
