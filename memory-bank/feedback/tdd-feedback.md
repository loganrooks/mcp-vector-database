### User Intervention - Insufficient Detail in Early Return Completion - [2025-04-28 18:43:12]
- **Trigger**: User denied `attempt_completion` for Early Return.
- **Context**: Invoked Early Return due to context limit (53%) after committing code and memory bank changes. The `attempt_completion` message lacked detail.
- **Action**: User requested more details about code changes and tests in the completion message.
- **Rationale**: Completion messages, even for Early Returns, should provide enough detail for validation and handover.
- **Outcome**: Will revise the `attempt_completion` message with more specifics.
- **Follow-up**: Ensure future `attempt_completion` messages are sufficiently detailed.
### User Intervention - Commit Before Early Return - [2025-04-28 18:40:57]
- **Trigger**: User denied `attempt_completion` for Early Return.
- **Context**: Invoked Early Return due to context limit (53%) after successful TDD cycles for `basic_reference_parser`. Attempted completion without committing changes.
- **Action**: User instructed to commit code changes and memory bank updates in separate commits before attempting completion, even for Early Return.
- **Rationale**: Standard procedure requires committing work before concluding a task segment or handing off, ensuring changes are saved.
- **Outcome**: Will proceed with commits before re-attempting completion.
- **Follow-up**: Ensure commits are made before `attempt_completion` in future, including Early Return scenarios.
### Early Return - Context Limit Reached - [2025-04-28 17:33:38]
- **Trigger**: Context size reached 52% after completing TDD cycle for `basic_reference_parser` (no year case).
- **Context**: Successfully added tests and minimal implementations/fixes for `call_grobid_extractor` (status error, no API URL), `parse_grobid_tei` (basic, parse error), `chunk_text_semantically` (placeholder basic, placeholder no paragraphs), and `basic_reference_parser` (simple, no year). All 17 tests in `tests/utils/test_text_processing.py` are passing.
- **Issue**: Context size (52%) exceeds the recommended threshold (40-50%), risking degraded performance and potential errors.
- **Attempts**: N/A (Proactive return based on context size).
- **Analysis**: Task involves multiple TDD cycles, gradually increasing context. Reached limit before testing `parse_references` and `call_anystyle_parser`.
- **Self-Correction**: Following protocol to invoke Early Return when context limit is reached.
- **Context %**: 52%
- **Recommendation**: Invoke Early Return. Suggest SPARC create a `new_task` for TDD mode to continue testing `src/philograph/utils/text_processing.py`, specifically focusing on the remaining functions: `parse_references` and `call_anystyle_parser`. Provide link to this feedback entry and relevant Memory Bank sections (`tdd.md`) for context handover.
### Blocker & Early Return - [2025-04-28 16:53:10]
- **Trigger**: Persistent failure of `test_call_grobid_extractor_api_request_error` and context approaching limit (was 50% before task resumption, currently 34% after).
- **Context**: Attempting Green phase for `call_grobid_extractor` API error handling. Test mocks `http_client.make_async_request` to raise `httpx.RequestError`.
- **Issue**: The test fails with `AssertionError: assert {'metadata': ...} is None`. The function does not return `None` as expected when the `RequestError` is raised; instead, it proceeds and returns placeholder data.
- **Attempts**:
    1. Added specific `except httpx.RequestError` block returning `None`. (Failed)
    2. Restructured `try...except` blocks to isolate network call. (Failed)
    3. Ensured general `except Exception` block returns `None`. (Failed)
- **Analysis**: The exception raised by the mock's `side_effect` doesn't seem to be caught correctly by the `except` block in the `async` function `call_grobid_extractor`. The exact reason is unclear - potentially an issue with async exception handling, the mocking strategy, or the `try...except` structure interaction.
- **Self-Correction**: Multiple attempts to fix the code logic based on the test failure were unsuccessful.
- **Context %**: 34% (previously 50%)
- **Recommendation**: Invoke Early Return. Suggest `debug` mode investigate the exception handling discrepancy in `call_grobid_extractor` or refine the mocking strategy for `test_call_grobid_extractor_api_request_error`.
### [2025-04-28 14:30:10] - User Intervention: Clarification on Test Scope Discrepancy
- **Trigger:** User message following Early Return invocation.
- **Context:** Early Return was invoked due to `test_get_db_pool_failure` failing during verification, contradicting `debug` mode's report.
- **Action:** User suggested the discrepancy might be due to TDD running the full test file (`pytest tests/data_access/test_db_layer.py`) while `debug` mode likely ran only the specific test (`pytest tests/data_access/test_db_layer.py::test_get_db_pool_failure`).
- **Rationale:** Test interactions within a file could cause a test to fail when run as part of the suite, even if it passes in isolation.
- **Outcome:** Acknowledged feedback. Will re-attempt verification targeting only the specific test.
- **Follow-up:** Execute `pytest tests/data_access/test_db_layer.py::test_get_db_pool_failure`. Log results. If it passes, proceed with original task (testing `text_processing.py`), noting the interaction issue. If it fails, re-invoke Early Return. Also, monitor high context size (currently ~139%).

### [2025-04-28 14:28:05] - Early Return: Persistent Contradictory Test Failure
- **Trigger:** Second consecutive failure of `pytest tests/data_access/test_db_layer.py::test_get_db_pool_failure` during verification, despite debug mode reporting it fixed.
- **Context:** Attempting to resume TDD task after debug mode intervention. Re-synced Memory Bank which confirmed debug mode's report of test passing. Re-ran verification test.
- **Action:** Executed `pytest tests/data_access/test_db_layer.py`. Test failed again. Invoking Early Return.
- **Rationale:** The test `test_get_db_pool_failure` is persistently failing in this environment, directly contradicting the latest report from `debug` mode ([2025-04-28 13:24:10]). This indicates a fundamental, unresolved issue (potentially environment-related, code state mismatch, or a deeper mocking problem) that prevents reliable testing. Proceeding is impossible under these conditions. Context size is acceptable (25%), but the blocker is intractable.
- **Outcome:** Halting TDD task execution.
- **Follow-up:** Recommend SPARC intervention to resolve the environmental/state discrepancy or assign a different mode (perhaps `devops` or `debug` again with specific instructions to verify environment consistency) to definitively resolve the `test_get_db_pool_failure` blocker.

### [2025-04-28 13:19:45] - Critical Evaluation: Failed Verification of Debug Fix
- **Trigger:** Running `pytest tests/data_access/test_db_layer.py` as per task instructions to verify the fix for `test_get_db_pool_failure`.
- **Context:** Task brief and `activeContext.md` indicated `debug` mode successfully fixed the test in commit `e5dfc68`. Previous feedback logs detail extensive issues with mocking this specific test.
- **Action:** Executed `pytest tests/data_access/test_db_layer.py`.
- **Rationale:** Standard procedure to verify fixes before proceeding.
- **Outcome:** Test `test_get_db_pool_failure` FAILED with `Failed: DID NOT RAISE <class 'ConnectionError'>`. This directly contradicts the reported fix. The underlying mocking issue persists.
- **Follow-up:** Halting TDD task. Delegating back to `debug` mode via `new_task` to re-investigate the persistent failure and the discrepancy in reporting. The test must pass reliably before other modules can be tested. [Ref: Issue-ID: TDD-DBPOOL-FAIL-20250428]

### [2025-04-28 12:23:49] - User Intervention: Insufficient Detail in Early Return

**Trigger:** User denied `attempt_completion` for Early Return.
**Context:** Invoked Early Return due to persistent failure of `test_get_db_pool_failure` and high context.
**Action:** User requested a more detailed Early Return message for better handover.
**Rationale:** The initial message summarized the blocker but lacked specifics on attempts and state needed for seamless continuation by another mode or user.
**Outcome:** Will provide a more detailed `attempt_completion` message.
**Follow-up:** Ensure future Early Return messages include: specific test/function failing, summary of distinct debugging attempts, relevant file paths, current context percentage, and clear, actionable recommendations for next steps (e.g., specific debugging approaches, delegation targets).

### [2025-04-28 12:21:16] - Early Return: Persistent Test Failure & High Context

**Trigger:** Persistent failure of `tests/data_access/test_db_layer.py::test_get_db_pool_failure` and context size reaching 53%.
**Context:** Attempting to fix the test mocking for database connection pool initialization failure. Multiple strategies attempted (`apply_diff`, `write_to_file`, different patch targets, `try/except` vs `pytest.raises`, mocking constructor vs connection CM entry).
**Action:** Invoking Early Return clause.
**Rationale:** The test consistently fails with `AssertionError: ConnectionError was not raised`, indicating the mocked exception (`psycopg.OperationalError`) is not being caught and re-raised as `ConnectionError` by the `get_db_pool` function's `except` block, despite the source code appearing correct. The exact cause of the mocking interaction failure is unclear after several attempts. High context size (53%) also risks degraded performance.
**Outcome:** Halting task execution.
**Follow-up:** Recommend investigation by `debug` mode or restarting the task with a fresh context to analyze the mocking interaction in `test_get_db_pool_failure` more deeply.

### [2025-04-28 09:56:23] - Early Return Invoked
- **Trigger**: User instruction during TDD cycle for `mcp_utils.py`.
- **Context**: Task was to implement unit/integration tests for `src/philograph/`. Tests for `config.py`, `utils/file_utils.py`, `utils/http_client.py`, and `utils/mcp_utils.py` were completed successfully. Dependencies (`pytest-dotenv`, `pytest-httpx`, `h2`) were added. Minor code fixes were applied (`file_utils.py` import, `test_http_client.py` assertion). Context size ~37%.
- **Action**: Halting TDD task as instructed.
- **Rationale**: User requested early return to address "poor version control practices and the git debt".
- **Outcome**: TDD task paused before testing `utils/text_processing.py`.
- **Follow-up**: Awaiting instructions or task delegation to address version control.
