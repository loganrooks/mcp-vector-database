### User Intervention - [2025-05-02 02:46:24]
- **Trigger**: User message after `attempt_completion`.
- **Context**: Attempted completion after verifying tests passed and updating Memory Bank, but before committing changes as required by task instructions.
- **Action**: User instructed to commit changes first.
- **Rationale**: Oversight in following task step order.
- **Outcome**: Will commit changes before re-attempting completion.
- **Follow-up**: Ensure commit step is included before final completion attempt.
### Task Completion Summary - [2025-05-02 02:36:41]
- **Trigger**: Completion of TDD cycles for `/search` endpoint robustness.
- **Context**: Task was to add tests for empty results, embedding errors, DB errors, and invalid filter format for the `/search` API endpoint.
- **Actions Taken**:
    - Reviewed existing tests: Found tests covering empty results (`test_search_empty_results`) and invalid filter format (`test_search_invalid_filter_format`).
    - Added `test_search_embedding_error`: Test passed unexpectedly (Red skipped) as existing `RuntimeError` handler covered it. Fixed assertion in test to include `offset=0`.
    - Added `test_search_db_error`: Test failed (Red) due to generic error message. Fixed patch strategy after `AttributeError`. Added specific `except psycopg.Error` block in `src/philograph/api/main.py` (Green). No refactoring needed.
    - Verified all 13 `/search` tests pass together using `pytest -k test_search`.
    - Updated Memory Bank (`activeContext.md`, `globalContext.md`, `tdd.md`, `tdd-feedback.md`).
- **Files Affected**:
    - `tests/api/test_main.py` (Added 2 tests, fixed syntax/assertions/patch targets)
    - `src/philograph/api/main.py` (Added `except psycopg.Error` block)
    - `memory-bank/activeContext.md` (Updated)
    - `memory-bank/globalContext.md` (Updated)
    - `memory-bank/mode-specific/tdd.md` (Updated)
    - `memory-bank/feedback/tdd-feedback.md` (Updated)
- **Verification**: Ran `sudo docker-compose exec philograph-backend pytest /app/tests/api/test_main.py -k test_search`. Result: 13 passed, 38 deselected.
- **Status**: Task completed successfully. All required test cases for `/search` robustness are implemented and passing.
- **Next Steps**: Await further instructions or proceed with testing other API endpoints.
### Task Completion Summary - [2025-05-01 23:21:32]
- **Trigger**: Completion of TDD cycles for `GET /acquire/status/{id}`.
- **Context**: Resumed task after previous Early Return [Ref: TDD Feedback 2025-05-01 23:06:06]. Objective was to add tests for Completed, Failed, Not Found, and Invalid ID Format cases.
- **Actions Taken**:
    - Added `test_get_acquisition_status_completed`: Fixed import/mock data issues. Test passed (Red skipped).
    - Added `test_get_acquisition_status_failed`: Fixed assertion dictionary. Test passed (Red skipped).
    - Added `test_get_acquisition_status_not_found`: Test failed on assertion. Fixed API 404 detail message in `src/philograph/api/main.py`. Test passed (Green).
    - Added `test_get_acquisition_status_invalid_id_format`: Test passed (Red skipped, FastAPI validation).
    - Verified all 5 tests for `GET /acquire/status/{id}` pass together.
    - Updated Memory Bank (`activeContext.md`, `globalContext.md`, `tdd.md`).
- **Files Affected**:
    - `tests/api/test_main.py` (Added 4 tests, fixed import/assertions)
    - `src/philograph/api/main.py` (Modified 404 detail message)
    - `memory-bank/activeContext.md` (Updated)
    - `memory-bank/globalContext.md` (Updated)
    - `memory-bank/mode-specific/tdd.md` (Updated)
- **Verification**: Ran `sudo docker-compose exec philograph-backend pytest /app/tests/api/test_main.py -k test_get_acquisition_status`. Result: 5 passed.
- **Status**: Task completed successfully. All required test cases for `GET /acquire/status/{id}` are implemented and passing.
- **Next Steps**: Proceed with testing other API endpoints as per `pseudocode/tier0/backend_api.md` or await further instructions.
### Early Return - Context Limit Reached (50%) - [2025-05-01 23:06:06]
- **Trigger**: Context size reached 50% after verifying `test_get_acquisition_status_success_pending`.
- **Context**: Task was to resume TDD for Backend API (`src/philograph/api/main.py`) after corruption fix.
- **Issue**: Context limit reached, preventing further TDD cycles without risking degraded performance.
- **Progress**:
    - Fixed 4 regressions in `tests/data_access/test_db_layer.py` related to `get_collection_items` mock assertions. Verified full suite passes (257 passed, 1 skipped).
    - Added and verified tests for `GET /documents/{id}/references` (success, not found, DB error, empty list). Required fixing imports, patch targets, and Pydantic model (`ReferenceDetail`).
    - Added and verified tests for `GET /chunks/{id}` (success, not found, DB error, invalid ID format). Required adding placeholder DB function, API endpoint, Pydantic model (`ChunkResponse`), and fixing test code errors (imports, patch targets, assertions, model definition order).
    - Added and verified test for `GET /acquire/status/{id}` (pending). Required adding import to `api/main.py` and fixing patch target/mock data in test.
- **Analysis**: Completed a significant block of API tests, including restoring previously missing tests and adding new ones. Context limit reached before completing all `/acquire/status/{id}` cases.
- **Self-Correction**: Following `context_management` protocol to invoke Early Return.
- **Context %**: 50%
- **Recommendation**: Invoke Early Return. Suggest SPARC create a `new_task` for TDD mode to continue testing `src/philograph/api/main.py`. Focus on: 1) Remaining `/acquire/status/{id}` cases (completed, failed, not found, invalid ID format). 2) Proceed to other endpoints as per `pseudocode/tier0/backend_api.md`. Provide link to this feedback entry and relevant Memory Bank sections (`tdd.md`, `activeContext.md`) for context handover. [Ref: Original Task 2025-05-01 22:37:26]
### Early Return - Intractable Syntax Errors (File Corruption) - [2025-05-01 21:44:52]
- **Trigger**: Persistent Pylance syntax errors ("Statements must be separated...", "Expected attribute name after '.'") appearing on multiple docstring lines throughout `tests/api/test_main.py` after attempting to add `test_get_collection_db_error` and fix initial insertion errors. Context: ~22%.
- **Context**: Task was to continue TDD for `src/philograph/api/main.py`. Completed `/search` offset test. Attempted to add `test_get_collection_db_error`.
- **Issue**: Initial `insert_content` placed the new test inside a previous docstring. Subsequent `apply_diff` attempts to remove, re-insert, and rewrite the docstring failed to resolve Pylance errors, which then spread to numerous other docstrings in the file, indicating likely file corruption (hidden characters, encoding issues, etc.).
- **Attempts**:
    1. Inserted `test_get_collection_db_error` using `insert_content`. Pylance errors appeared.
    2. Removed inserted block using `apply_diff`.
    3. Re-inserted block using `insert_content`. Pylance errors persisted.
    4. Rewrote problematic docstring line using `apply_diff` (identical content). Failed.
    5. Rewrote problematic docstring line with minor change using `apply_diff`. Succeeded, but Pylance errors persisted.
    6. Rewrote entire docstring block as single line using `apply_diff`. Succeeded, but Pylance errors persisted and spread.
    7. Removed stray lines from previous docstring using `apply_diff`. Succeeded, but Pylance errors persisted and spread further.
- **Analysis**: The file `tests/api/test_main.py` appears corrupted, likely due to multiple tool operations. Targeted fixes are ineffective. "Three Strikes" rule triggered for `apply_diff`.
- **Self-Correction**: Following Early Return Clause due to intractable syntax blocker/file corruption.
- **Context %**: ~22% (Manually calculated: 219,639 / 1,000,000)
- **Recommendation**: Invoke Early Return. Delegate to `debug` mode via `new_task` to investigate and fix the widespread syntax errors/corruption in `tests/api/test_main.py`. Debug mode should consider using `write_to_file` to rewrite the entire file cleanly, potentially referencing the state before these recent modifications or carefully reconstructing it. Provide link to this feedback entry. [Ref: Original Task 2025-05-01 21:38:52]
### Early Return - Intractable Syntax Errors in Test File - [2025-05-01 21:00:00]
- **Trigger**: Persistent `SyntaxError` during `pytest` execution and multiple Pylance errors reported after attempting to add `test_create_collection_db_error` to `tests/api/test_main.py`. Context: ~29%.
- **Context**: Task was to continue TDD for `src/philograph/api/main.py`. Completed tests for `/acquire/confirm` (404, 500). Attempted to add test for `POST /collections` DB error.
- **Issue**: `insert_content` and subsequent `apply_diff` attempts to add/fix `test_create_collection_db_error` resulted in widespread `SyntaxError`s reported by Pylance across numerous docstrings (lines 484, 523, 544, etc.) and confirmed by `pytest` collection failure (`SyntaxError: invalid syntax` at line 485). The file appears corrupted.
- **Attempts**:
    1. Added `test_create_collection_db_error` using `insert_content`. `pytest` failed with `SyntaxError`.
    2. Attempted `apply_diff` to rewrite the docstring (lines 484-487). Failed (`identical content`).
    3. Attempted `apply_diff` to rewrite the docstring with slightly different text (line 484). `apply_diff` succeeded, but Pylance errors persisted, and `pytest` still failed with `SyntaxError`.
    4. Attempted `apply_diff` to rewrite the entire function block (lines 481-497). `apply_diff` succeeded, but Pylance errors persisted.
- **Analysis**: The file `tests/api/test_main.py` seems to have widespread syntax issues, possibly related to line endings or hidden characters introduced by file modifications, that are not being resolved by targeted `apply_diff` operations. "Three Strikes" rule triggered for `apply_diff`.
- **Self-Correction**: Following Early Return Clause due to intractable syntax blocker.
- **Context %**: ~29% (Manually calculated: 291,970 / 1,000,000)
- **Recommendation**: Invoke Early Return. Delegate to `debug` mode via `new_task` to investigate and fix the widespread syntax errors in `tests/api/test_main.py`. The file needs to be cleaned up before TDD can resume. Provide link to this feedback entry. [Ref: Original Task 2025-05-01 20:50:18]

### Early Return - Intractable CLI Test Mocking Blocker - [2025-05-01 19:54:41]
- **Trigger**: Persistent failure of `tests/cli/test_cli_main.py::test_search_*` tests despite multiple mocking strategies. Context at 46%.
- **Context**: Task was to fix failing CLI search tests related to mocking API calls (`make_api_request`) and handling exit codes, assuming backend fixes were successful.
- **Issue**: Tests consistently fail to verify calls to mocked `make_api_request` ("Called 0 times") or related display functions when using `CliRunner.invoke`. Attempts to control `API_URL` via patching (`config` object, `config.API_URL` attribute) or `env` parameter were ineffective. Additionally, `test_search_api_error` fails `assert result.exit_code == 1` when `make_api_request` is mocked with `side_effect=typer.Exit(1)`, suggesting `CliRunner` doesn't map this exception to exit code 1.
- **Attempts**:
    1. Patched `make_api_request` directly; mock not called.
    2. Patched `httpx.Client` + `config`; URL mismatch.
    3. Patched `httpx.Client` + `config.API_URL`; URL mismatch.
    4. Patched `httpx.Client` + `env={"API_URL": ...}`; URL mismatch, display/console mocks not called.
    5. Reverted to patching `make_api_request` directly with corrected payload assertions; mock not called.
    6. Changed patch target string for `make_api_request` to fully qualified path; mock not called.
- **Analysis**: The root cause appears to be an incompatibility or complex interaction between `unittest.mock.patch`, the Typer/Click application structure, and the `CliRunner.invoke` execution context, preventing mocks from being applied correctly or configuration overrides from taking effect. The exit code handling for `typer.Exit` within `CliRunner` also seems problematic. "Three Strikes" rule triggered.
- **Self-Correction**: Following Early Return Clause due to intractable mocking blocker and context limit approaching.
- **Context %**: 46% (Manually calculated: 458,804 / 1,000,000)
- **Recommendation**: Invoke Early Return. Delegate to `debug` mode via `new_task` to investigate the mocking and `CliRunner` interaction issues in `tests/cli/test_cli_main.py`. Specifically focus on why `@patch('philograph.cli.main.make_api_request')` (or other targets) fails to intercept calls during `runner.invoke` and why `typer.Exit(1)` results in `result.exit_code == 0`. Consider alternative testing approaches if necessary (e.g., directly testing command functions without `CliRunner`). Provide link to this feedback entry. [Ref: Original Task 2025-05-01 19:39:46]

---
### Early Return - Regression Test Failure (Embedding Error) - [2025-05-01 13:36:27]
- **Trigger**: Full `pytest` suite execution completed with 3 failures after DB connection fix [Ref: Issue-ID: PYTEST-SIGKILL-DB-CONN-20250430]. Context: ~12%.
- **Context**: Task was to run full regression test suite to verify system health after DB fix and environment migration.
- **Issue**: 3 CLI tests failed (`test_search_success_query_only`, `test_search_success_with_filters`, `test_search_empty_results`) due to the backend API `/search` endpoint returning `500 - {"detail":"Search failed due to unexpected embedding error"}`.
- **Attempts**:
    1. Ran `sudo docker-compose exec philograph-backend pytest`. Result: 244 passed, 3 failed, 1 skipped.
- **Analysis**: The regression test confirms the DB connection fix is stable (no `SIGKILL` or connection errors). However, the persistent 500 error on `/search` related to embedding generation [Ref: Issue-ID: CLI-API-500-ERRORS] remains a blocker for full test suite success.
- **Self-Correction**: Following Early Return Clause as the task objective (verify DB fix via regression) is complete, but a known, separate blocker prevents full success.
- **Context %**: ~12% (Manually calculated: 124,670 / 1,000,000)
- **Recommendation**: Invoke Early Return. Delegate to `debug` mode via `new_task` to investigate the root cause of the `500 - {"detail":"Search failed due to unexpected embedding error"}` originating from the `/search` API endpoint. Provide link to this feedback entry, the `pytest` output, and relevant Memory Bank sections (`tdd.md`, `activeContext.md`). [Ref: Issue-ID: CLI-API-500-ERRORS]

---
### Early Return - Persistent SIGKILL Blocker &amp; Context Limit - [2025-04-30 07:15:15]
- **Trigger**: Third consecutive `execute_command` attempt to run `pytest` within the `philograph-backend` container terminated with `SIGKILL` (signal 9), even when targeting a single test. Context size reached 41%.
- **Context**: Task was to verify fixes applied by `debug` mode (fixture scope change, 2GB memory limit) intended to resolve previous `SIGKILL` errors during `pytest` execution.
- **Issue**: The `SIGKILL` error persists despite the applied fixes and increased memory limit. The error occurs even when running a single test (`tests/api/test_main.py::test_get_document_success`), strongly suggesting the OOM condition happens during the initial pytest setup or the module-scoped fixture initialization (`test_client`), which loads the FastAPI application (`src/philograph/api/main.py`).
- **Attempts**:
    1. Ran `pytest -v -x tests/api/test_main.py` after `debug` mode increased memory limit to 2GB. Result: `SIGKILL` after 14 tests.
    2. Ran `pytest -v -x tests/api/test_main.py::test_get_document_success` (single test). Result: `SIGKILL` during test setup.
- **Analysis**: The root cause is highly likely excessive memory consumption (>2GB) during the FastAPI application startup process itself, triggered by the `test_client` fixture. This prevents any tests in `tests/api/test_main.py` from running successfully. The "Three Strikes" rule for the `execute_command` tool is triggered.
- **Self-Correction**: Following "Three Strikes" rule and `error_handling_protocol`. Aborting further `pytest` attempts. Invoking Early Return due to intractable blocker and context limit approaching.
- **Context %**: 41% (Manually calculated: 412,638 / 1,000,000)
- **Recommendation**: Invoke Early Return. Delegate to `debug` mode via `new_task` to investigate the root cause of the excessive memory consumption during the FastAPI application (`src/philograph/api/main.py`) initialization within the `philograph-backend` container. Investigation should focus on:
    - Profiling memory usage during app startup (if tools are available in the container).
    - Examining `src/philograph/api/main.py` and its dependencies for potentially large resource loading (e.g., models, data caches) or inefficient initialization code.
    - Considering further increasing the container memory limit (e.g., `4g`) in `docker-compose.yml` as a potential temporary workaround or diagnostic step.
    Provide link to this feedback entry and relevant Memory Bank sections (`tdd.md`, `activeContext.md`). [Ref: Previous Feedback 2025-04-29 16:31:45]
### Blocker &amp; Early Return - Repeated SIGKILL during Pytest Execution - [2025-04-29 16:31:45]
- **Trigger**: Two consecutive `execute_command` attempts to run `pytest` within the `philograph-backend` container terminated with `SIGKILL` (signal 9).
- **Context**: Task was to run the full test suite (`pytest`) to assess API status after GCP credential configuration. Docker services were confirmed running.
- **Issue**:
    - First attempt (`docker compose exec philograph-backend pytest`) was killed during `tests/api/test_main.py`.
    - Second attempt (`docker compose exec philograph-backend pytest -v -x tests/api/test_main.py`) was killed almost immediately, before printing test session details.
- **Attempts**:
    1. Ran full `pytest` suite. Result: `SIGKILL`.
    2. Ran `pytest -v -x` targeting `tests/api/test_main.py`. Result: `SIGKILL`.
- **Analysis**: The repeated, early `SIGKILL` strongly suggests an Out-of-Memory (OOM) condition within the `philograph-backend` container during `pytest` startup or fixture initialization, particularly for `tests/api/test_main.py`. This might be related to the recent environment changes (GCP credentials) triggering unexpected resource consumption during test setup. Previous test runs completed [Ref: TDD Feedback 2025-04-29 11:30:13], making this a new, critical blocker.
- **Self-Correction**: Following "Three Strikes" rule (2 strikes) and `error_handling_protocol`. Aborting further `pytest` attempts. Invoking Early Return.
- **Context %**: ~12%
- **Recommendation**: Invoke Early Return. Delegate to `debug` mode via `new_task` to investigate the root cause of the `SIGKILL` errors during `pytest` execution in the `philograph-backend` container. Investigation should focus on memory usage during test setup, particularly for `tests/api/test_main.py`, and potential interactions with the new environment configuration. Provide link to this feedback entry. [Ref: Original Task 2025-04-29 16:29:46]

### Early Return - Multiple Unexpected Test Failures (Regression Check) - [2025-04-29 11:30:13]
- **Trigger**: Full test suite run (`docker compose exec philograph-backend pytest`) after resolving filename conflict (`tests/cli/test_cli_main.py`) resulted in 25 failures and 1 error.
- **Context**: Task was to run regression tests after `/ingest` 404 fix [Ref: Debug Completion 2025-04-29 11:25:29], verify the fix, adapt `test_ingest_success`, and ensure all tests pass.
- **Issue**: While the expected failure for `test_ingest_success` (due to 404) occurred, numerous other tests failed unexpectedly across multiple modules:
    - **API (`tests/api/test_main.py`):** `test_get_collection_empty`, `test_acquire_confirm_success` failing with 404 instead of 200.
    - **CLI (`tests/cli/test_cli_main.py`):** `test_ingest_api_error`, `test_search_api_error` failing due to real API errors (404/500) occurring before mock assertions. Search tests (`test_search_*`) failing due to known backend 500 embedding error [Ref: Issue-ID: CLI-API-500-ERRORS].
    - **Ingestion (`tests/ingestion/test_pipeline.py`):** 16 tests failing with path resolution issues ("File or directory not found"). This seems like a significant regression.
    - **Config (`tests/test_config.py`):** `test_get_bool_env_variable_not_exists_defaults_false` failing due to missing `DB_PASSWORD` env var during test execution.
- **Attempts**:
    1. Renamed `tests/cli/test_main.py` to `tests/cli/test_cli_main.py` to fix collection error.
    2. Ran `docker compose exec philograph-backend pytest`.
- **Analysis**: The `/ingest` 404 fix itself seems successful based on the `test_ingest_success` log. However, significant regressions or previously hidden issues have surfaced in API routing/logic, Ingestion path handling, Config test setup, and CLI error test structure. The Ingestion failures are particularly concerning.
- **Self-Correction**: Following Early Return Clause due to multiple unexpected failures preventing task completion.
- **Context %**: ~13% (Manually calculated: 131,185 / 1,000,000)
- **Recommendation**: Invoke Early Return. Delegate to `debug` mode to investigate the root causes of the widespread failures, prioritizing:
    1. The 16 Ingestion test failures related to path resolution ("File or directory not found").
    2. The API 404 errors in `test_get_collection_empty` and `test_acquire_confirm_success`.
    3. The Config test failure (`DB_PASSWORD` missing).
    4. Recommend `code` or `tdd` mode fix the structure of CLI error tests (`test_ingest_api_error`, `test_search_api_error`) to correctly handle pre-mock API failures or improve mocking.
    Provide link to this feedback entry and the full `pytest` output. [Ref: Original Task 2025-04-29 11:28:16]

### Early Return - Verification Failed for /ingest Fix - [2025-04-29 10:14:40]
- **Trigger**: Verification test `test_ingest_success` failed unexpectedly during task "Verify Backend API Fixes &amp; Resume CLI Testing".
- **Context**: Task involved verifying fixes for `/search` (dummy GCP key) and `/ingest` (404 handling) applied by debug mode [Ref: Debug Feedback 2025-04-29 09:26:29]. Verification for `/search` passed (original credential error gone, now fails as expected with embedding error).
- **Issue**: Verification for `/ingest` failed. Expected API to return 404 for non-existent file path (`dummy_test_doc.pdf`), but it returned `500 - {"detail":"An unexpected error occurred during ingestion."}`.
- **Attempts**:
    1. Corrected `docker-compose.yml` network config for `db` service.
    2. Restarted services: `docker compose down &amp;&amp; docker compose up -d --build`.
    3. Ran `/search` verification test (`test_search_success_query_only`): Passed verification (error changed as expected).
    4. Ran `/ingest` verification test (`test_ingest_success`): Failed verification (API returned 500, not 404).
- **Analysis**: The fix applied by debug mode to the `/ingest` handler in `src/philograph/api/main.py` to return 404 for "File not found" errors is not working as intended or was incomplete/reverted. The API is still throwing a generic 500 error.
- **Self-Correction**: Following `error_handling_protocol` to stop and report verification failure.
- **Context %**: 42% (Manually calculated: 415,142 / 1,000,000)
- **Recommendation**: Invoke Early Return. Suggest SPARC delegate to `debug` mode to re-investigate the `/ingest` endpoint handler in `src/philograph/api/main.py` and ensure it correctly returns a 404 status code when `process_document` raises a `FileNotFoundError`. Provide link to this feedback entry and relevant Memory Bank sections (`activeContext.md`, `debug-feedback.md`). [Ref: Original Task 2025-04-29 09:27:42]
### User Intervention - Incorrect Context Percentage - [2025-04-29 10:07:51]
- **Trigger**: User feedback on Early Return completion message.
- **Context**: Invoked Early Return upon task resumption due to reported context size of 159% (318,967 tokens).
- **Action**: User clarified that the percentage calculation is bugged (using 200k instead of 1M denominator). Manually recalculated percentage as (318,967 / 1,000,000) * 100 = 31.9%.
- **Rationale**: The actual context percentage is below the 40-50% threshold, so Early Return was unnecessary.
- **Outcome**: Retracting Early Return. Will resume the task by retrying the last command. Will manually calculate context percentage going forward.
- **Follow-up**: Retry `docker compose down &amp;&amp; docker compose up -d --build`. Update `activeContext.md`.
### Early Return - Context Limit Exceeded (159%) - [2025-04-29 09:40:23]
- **Trigger**: Context size reached 159% upon task resumption.
- **Context**: Task was to verify backend API fixes for `/search` (dummy GCP key) and `/ingest` (404 handling) and resume TDD for `src/philograph/cli/main.py`. Attempted `docker compose down &amp;&amp; docker compose up -d --build` before interruption, but result was not received.
- **Issue**: Context size drastically exceeds the 40-50% threshold, preventing safe continuation.
- **Attempts**: N/A (Proactive return upon resumption).
- **Analysis**: Cannot proceed with verification or testing due to context limit.
- **Self-Correction**: Following `context_management` protocol to invoke Early Return.
- **Context %**: 159%
- **Recommendation**: Invoke Early Return. Suggest SPARC create a `new_task` for TDD mode to retry the original task: "Verify Backend API Fixes & Resume CLI Testing". The first step should be to run `docker compose down &amp;&amp; docker compose up -d --build` to ensure the environment reflects the latest fixes. Then proceed with verification steps outlined in the original task brief [Ref: Original Task 2025-04-29 09:27:42]. Provide link to this feedback entry and relevant Memory Bank sections (`tdd.md`, `activeContext.md`, `debug-feedback.md`) for context handover.
### User Intervention - [2025-04-29 09:18:06]
- **Trigger**: User asked why `sudo` wasn't used for the permission error during file creation.
- **Context**: Following `execute_command` failure due to permissions when trying to `touch ./data/source_documents/dummy_test_doc.pdf`.
- **Action**: Explained the security rationale for avoiding `sudo` and reiterated the sufficiency of using a relative path in the test file for mocked API calls.
- **Rationale**: Address user query and confirm the chosen safer alternative.
- **Outcome**: User acknowledged (implicitly). Proceeding with `apply_diff`.
- **Follow-up**: Apply the path change using `apply_diff`.
### Tool Error &amp; Strategy Change - [2025-04-29 09:17:37]
- **Trigger**: `execute_command` failed with "Permission denied" when trying to `touch ./data/source_documents/dummy_test_doc.pdf`.
- **Context**: Attempting to create a dummy file to replace the invalid path `"some/document.pdf"` in `/ingest` CLI tests.
- **Analysis**: The execution environment lacks permission to write to the target host directory.
- **Action**: Aborting file creation. Will modify the test path directly to a relative path (`"dummy_test_doc.pdf"`) using `apply_diff`. This path will be interpreted relative to the backend's source document directory (`/app/data/source_documents` in the container), which is sufficient for the mocked tests.
- **Follow-up**: Apply the path change using `apply_diff`.
### User Intervention - [2025-04-29 09:12:57]
- **Trigger**: User denied `execute_command` to create `data/source_documents/dummy_test_doc.pdf`.
- **Context**: Preparing to fix invalid path `"some/document.pdf"` in `tests/cli/test_main.py` for `/ingest` tests.
- **Action**: User asked if a real PDF was needed.
- **Rationale**: User was confirming the necessity of the file content.
- **Outcome**: Explained that an empty file is sufficient as the test mocks the API call. Will retry the command.
- **Follow-up**: Retry `execute_command` to create the empty file, then proceed with `apply_diff` to fix the test path.
### Early Return - Context Limit Exceeded - [2025-04-29 04:48:59]
- **Trigger**: Context size reached 53% after completing TDD cycles for `status` command.
- **Context**: Resumed TDD for `src/philograph/cli/main.py`. Ran regression tests, identified and fixed issues in `search` command tests/implementation (switched to POST, corrected filter handling, removed irrelevant test). Ignored persistent backend 500 errors for `/ingest` and `/search`. Completed TDD cycles for `status` command: success (required minimal implementation), API error (passed unexpectedly), Not Found (passed unexpectedly), Invalid ID (required test fix to simulate API error handling). Memory Bank updated.
- **Issue**: Context size (53%) exceeds the recommended threshold (40-50%), risking degraded performance.
- **Attempts**: N/A (Proactive return based on context size).
- **Analysis**: Task objective to test the `status` command is complete. All planned tests for `status` were added and verified (passing, ignoring backend failures). Context limit reached upon completion of the objective.
- **Self-Correction**: Following `context_management` protocol to invoke Early Return.
- **Context %**: 53%
- **Recommendation**: Invoke Early Return. The TDD task for the `status` command is complete. The remaining 6 test failures appear related to backend issues (`/ingest` 500 error, `/search` 500 error - embedding generation) and should likely be addressed by `debug` or `code` mode focusing on the backend API (`src/philograph/api/main.py` and related services). Suggest SPARC create a `new_task` for debugging the backend API endpoints `/ingest` and `/search`.

### Early Return - Context Limit Reached & Docker Build Issue - [2025-04-29 00:40:30]
- **Trigger**: Context size reached ~51% during Docker build debugging.
- **Context**: Attempting to verify Docker test environment for `src/philograph/api/main.py`. Previous attempts to run `pytest` failed with "file or directory not found: /app/tests/api/test_main.py".
- **Issue**: The `tests` directory is not being copied into the `/app` directory in the Docker container, despite the `COPY tests /app/tests` instruction in `Dockerfile`.
- **Attempts**:
    1. Verified `COPY ./tests /app/tests` exists in `Dockerfile`.
    2. Added `RUN chown -R appuser:appuser /app` before `USER appuser` to fix potential permissions issues. Rebuilt image (`--no-cache`). `ls -l /app/tests` still failed ("No such file or directory").
    3. Verified `.dockerignore` does not exist.
    4. Listed `/app` contents; confirmed `src` is copied but `tests` is missing.
    5. Modified `COPY` paths to remove `./` (`COPY src /app/src`, `COPY tests /app/tests`). Rebuilt image (`--no-cache`). `ls -l /app` still showed `tests` missing.
    6. Added `RUN ls -l /app` immediately after `COPY` commands in `Dockerfile` for debugging during build.
- **Analysis**: The persistent failure of the `COPY tests /app/tests` command, despite various fixes and confirmation of the build context in `docker-compose.yml`, suggests a subtle issue with the Docker build process or context that prevents the `tests` directory from being included in the image. The next step was to analyze the output of the debug command added in attempt #6, but the context limit was reached.
- **Self-Correction**: Following `context_management` protocol to invoke Early Return due to context limit.
- **Context %**: ~51%
- **Recommendation**: Invoke Early Return. Suggest SPARC create a `new_task` for TDD (or potentially `debug`/`devops` if the Docker issue persists) to: 1. Rebuild the `philograph-backend` image using `docker compose build --no-cache philograph-backend` to capture the output of the added debug step (`RUN ls -l /app`). 2. Analyze the build output to determine why the `tests` directory is not being copied. 3. Fix the `Dockerfile` or build process based on the analysis. 4. Once the `tests` directory is confirmed present in the container, run `docker compose exec philograph-backend pytest /app/tests/api/test_main.py` to verify tests execute. 5. Proceed with the original testing objectives for the API endpoints. Provide link to this feedback entry. [Ref: Previous Early Return: 2025-04-29 00:29:14]

- **Recommendation**: Invoke Early Return. Suggest SPARC create a `new_task` for TDD mode to continue testing `src/philograph/ingestion/pipeline.py::process_document` directory logic. Focus on: 1) Directory containing subdirectories (mocking recursion). 2) Error handling during directory iteration (e.g., permission errors, if feasible to mock). Provide link to this feedback entry and relevant Memory Bank sections (`tdd.md`, `activeContext.md`) for context handover. [Ref: Previous Early Return: 2025-04-28 23:40:14]
### Early Return - Context Limit Approaching - [2025-04-28 23:40:14]
- **Trigger**: Context size reached 49.9% after completing TDD cycle for `process_document` (DB Add Reference Error).
- **Context**: Resumed testing `src/philograph/ingestion/pipeline.py::process_document`. Ran `test_process_document_db_check_error` (passed unexpectedly). Added and completed TDD cycles for `test_process_document_db_add_doc_error`, `test_process_document_db_add_section_error`. Ran `test_process_document_indexing_error` (passed unexpectedly). Added and completed TDD cycle for `test_process_document_db_add_reference_error` (required source code fix to re-raise exception). Memory Bank updated.
- **Issue**: Context size (49.9%) meets the recommended threshold (40-50%), risking degraded performance before testing directory processing logic or other potential edge cases.
- **Attempts**: N/A (Proactive return based on context size).
- **Analysis**: Task involves adding comprehensive tests for `process_document`. Covered all identified database error scenarios within the main transaction. Context limit reached before testing directory processing logic.
- **Self-Correction**: Following protocol to invoke Early Return when context limit is approached.
- **Context %**: 49.9%
- **Recommendation**: Invoke Early Return. Suggest SPARC create a `new_task` for TDD mode to continue testing `src/philograph/ingestion/pipeline.py`, focusing specifically on the directory processing logic (handling `path.is_dir()` case) and any other remaining edge cases identified from pseudocode or spec. Provide link to this feedback entry and relevant Memory Bank sections (`tdd.md`, `activeContext.md`) for context handover. [Ref: Previous Early Return: 2025-04-28 23:30:26]
### Early Return - Context Limit Approaching - [2025-04-28 23:30:26]
- **Trigger**: Context size reached 48% after adding `test_process_document_db_check_error`.
- **Context**: Resumed testing `src/philograph/ingestion/pipeline.py::process_document`. Added 7 tests: success case (passed after test fixes), skip existing (passed), file not found (passed), extraction error (passed), embedding error (passed), indexing error (passed), and DB check error (added, not run). Most tests passed unexpectedly, indicating existing implementation handles these paths. Memory Bank updated.
- **Issue**: Context size (48%) meets the recommended threshold (40-50%), risking degraded performance before running the latest test and adding further error/directory processing tests.
- **Attempts**: N/A (Proactive return based on context size).
- **Analysis**: Task involves adding comprehensive tests for `process_document`. Covered basic success, skipping, and several key error propagation paths. Context limit reached before verifying the last added test and covering remaining error scenarios and directory logic.
- **Self-Correction**: Following protocol to invoke Early Return when context limit is approached.
- **Context %**: 48%
- **Recommendation**: Invoke Early Return. Suggest SPARC create a `new_task` for TDD mode to continue testing `src/philograph/ingestion/pipeline.py::process_document`.

### Early Return - Context Limit Reached - [2025-04-28 23:20:31]
- **Trigger**: Context size reached 50% after adding tests for `extract_content_and_metadata`.
- **Context**: Resumed testing `src/philograph/ingestion/pipeline.py`. Completed tests for `get_embeddings_in_batches` (batching, dimension validation - 2 new tests, 8 total). Completed tests for `extract_content_and_metadata` (PDF, EPUB, TXT/MD, Unsupported dispatch - 4 new tests, 12 total). All tests passed unexpectedly or after minor test code fixes (leftover assertions, mock setup). No production code changes were needed for these functions. Memory Bank updated with TDD cycles and test results.
- **Issue**: Context size (50%) meets the recommended threshold (40-50%), risking degraded performance before testing the main `process_document` function.
- **Attempts**: N/A (Proactive return based on context size).
- **Analysis**: Task involves adding tests for the entire ingestion pipeline. Completed helper functions `get_embeddings_in_batches` and `extract_content_and_metadata`. Context limit reached before starting tests for the main orchestrator function `process_document`.
- **Self-Correction**: Following protocol to invoke Early Return when context limit is reached.
- **Context %**: 50%
- **Recommendation**: Invoke Early Return.

- **Trigger**: Context size reached ~42% after adding and running tests for `vector_search_chunks` (success, filters, invalid dimension). Increased to ~45% after MB updates.
- **Context**: Resumed testing `src/philograph/data_access/db_layer.py` after previous Early Return. Added tests for `add_chunks_batch` (success, empty, invalid dim, db error), `add_reference` (success, invalid FK), and `vector_search_chunks` (success, filters, invalid dim). All newly added tests passed immediately or after minor test adjustments (assertion fix for `vector_search_chunks_success`). Total tests in file now 32.
- **Issue**: Context size (~45%) exceeds the recommended threshold (40-50%), risking degraded performance before testing remaining `vector_search_chunks` cases (e.g., empty query, DB error) and relationship/collection operations.
- **Attempts**: N/A (Proactive return based on context size).
- **Analysis**: Task involves adding multiple tests for various database operations, incrementally increasing context. Reached limit before completing all planned tests for `vector_search_chunks` and subsequent functions.
- **Self-Correction**: Following protocol to invoke Early Return when context limit is reached.
- **Context %**: ~45%
- **Recommendation**: Invoke Early Return. Suggest SPARC create a `new_task` for TDD mode to continue testing `src/philograph/data_access/db_layer.py`, focusing on the remaining `vector_search_chunks` cases (empty query, DB error) and then relationship (`add_relationship`, `get_relationships`) and collection (`add_collection`, `add_item_to_collection`, `get_collection_items`) operations. Provide link to this feedback entry and relevant Memory Bank sections (`tdd.md`, `activeContext.md`) for context handover. [Ref: Previous Early Return: 2025-04-28 21:54:05]
### Early Return - Context Limit Approaching - [2025-04-28 21:54:05]
- **Trigger**: Context size reached 42% after adding tests for `add_chunk` (success and invalid dimension).
- **Context**: Resumed testing `src/philograph/data_access/db_layer.py`. Fixed minor issues in existing `json_serialize` tests. Set up `.venv` and installed dependencies. Added and verified tests for `add_document` (success, duplicate source path), `get_document_by_id` (success, not found), `check_document_exists` (true, false), `add_section` (success, invalid doc_id), and `add_chunk` (success, invalid dimension). All 25 tests in `tests/data_access/test_db_layer.py` are currently passing.
- **Issue**: Context size (42%) is approaching the recommended threshold (40-50%), risking degraded performance before testing the remaining functions (`add_chunks_batch`, `add_reference`, `vector_search_chunks`, `add_relationship`, `get_relationships`, `add_collection`, `add_item_to_collection`, `get_collection_items`).
- **Attempts**: N/A (Proactive return based on context size).

### User Intervention - Insufficient Detail in Early Return Completion - [2025-04-28 20:51:41]
- **Trigger**: User denied `attempt_completion` for Early Return (Context Limit).
- **Context**: Invoked Early Return due to context limit (52%) after committing code and memory bank changes for `db_layer` utility and connection management tests.
- **Action**: User requested more detail in the completion message.
- **Rationale**: Completion messages, even for Early Returns, must provide enough specific detail about actions taken, files affected, and verification steps for validation and handover, as per pre-completion check rules.
- **Outcome**: Will revise the `attempt_completion` message with more specifics about functions tested and fixes applied.
- **Follow-up**: Ensure future `attempt_completion` messages adhere to the required detail level.
### Early Return - Context Limit Reached - [2025-04-28 20:30:58]
- **Trigger**: Context size reached 51% after completing TDD cycles for `db_layer` utility functions and connection management (`format_vector_for_pgvector`, `json_serialize`, `get_db_pool`, `get_db_connection`, `close_db_pool`).
- **Context**: Successfully added and passed tests for utility functions and connection management in `tests/data_access/test_db_layer.py`. Fixed issues related to mocking `AsyncConnectionPool` (`TypeError: unexpected keyword argument 'row_factory'`, `AttributeError: 'coroutine' object has no attribute 'connection'`) and stray assertions (`NameError`). Resolved the historical `test_get_db_pool_failure` issue (Issue-ID: TDD-DBPOOL-FAIL-20250428) by applying the correct mocking strategy and fixing the source code (`db_pool` not reset on exception). All 15 tests related to these functions are passing.
- **Issue**: Context size (51%) exceeds the recommended threshold (40-50%), risking degraded performance and potential errors before starting the more complex CRUD operation tests.
- **Attempts**: N/A (Proactive return based on context size).
- **Analysis**: Task involves multiple TDD cycles for a complex module, gradually increasing context. Reached limit before testing CRUD and search operations.
- **Self-Correction**: Following protocol to invoke Early Return when context limit is reached.
- **Context %**: 51%
- **Recommendation**: Invoke Early Return. Suggest SPARC create a `new_task` for TDD mode to continue testing `src/philograph/data_access/db_layer.py`, focusing on the CRUD and search operations (e.g., `add_document`, `get_document_by_id`, `add_chunk`, `vector_search_chunks`, etc.). Provide link to this feedback entry and relevant Memory Bank sections (`tdd.md`, `activeContext.md`) for context handover.
### User Intervention - Insufficient Detail in Early Return Completion - [2025-04-28 18:43:12]
- **Trigger**: User denied `attempt_completion` for Early Return.
- **Context**: Invoked Early Return due to context limit (53%) after committing code and memory bank changes. The `attempt_completion` message lacked detail.
- **Action**: User requested more details about code changes and tests in the completion message.
- **Rationale**: Completion messages, even for Early Returns, should provide enough detail for validation and handover.
- **Outcome**: Will revise the `attempt_completion` message with more specifics.
- **Follow-up**: Ensure future `attempt_completion` messages are sufficiently detailed.
### User Intervention - Commit Before Early Return - [2025-04-28 18:40:57]
- **Trigger**: User denied `attempt_completion` for Early Return.
- **Context**: Invoked Early Return due to context limit (53%) after successful TDD cycles for `basic_reference_parser`. Attempted completion without committing changes.
- **Action**: User instructed to commit code changes and memory bank updates in separate commits before attempting completion, even for Early Return.
- **Rationale**: Standard procedure requires committing work before concluding a task segment or handing off, ensuring changes are saved.
- **Outcome**: Will proceed with commits before re-attempting completion.
- **Follow-up**: Ensure commits are made before `attempt_completion` in future, including Early Return scenarios.
### Early Return - Context Limit Reached - [2025-04-28 17:33:38]
- **Trigger**: Context size reached 52% after completing TDD cycle for `basic_reference_parser` (no year case).
- **Context**: Successfully added tests and minimal implementations/fixes for `call_grobid_extractor` (status error, no API URL), `parse_grobid_tei` (basic, parse error), `chunk_text_semantically` (placeholder basic, placeholder no paragraphs), and `basic_reference_parser` (simple, no year). All 17 tests in `tests/utils/test_text_processing.py` are passing.
- **Issue**: Context size (52%) exceeds the recommended threshold (40-50%), risking degraded performance and potential errors.
- **Attempts**: N/A (Proactive return based on context size).
- **Analysis**: Task involves multiple TDD cycles, gradually increasing context. Reached limit before testing `parse_references` and `call_anystyle_parser`.
- **Self-Correction**: Following protocol to invoke Early Return when context limit is reached.
- **Context %**: 52%
- **Recommendation**: Invoke Early Return. Suggest SPARC create a `new_task` for TDD mode to continue testing `src/philograph/utils/text_processing.py`, specifically focusing on the remaining functions: `parse_references` and `call_anystyle_parser`. Provide link to this feedback entry and relevant Memory Bank sections (`tdd.md`) for context handover.
### Blocker & Early Return - [2025-04-28 16:53:10]
- **Trigger**: Persistent failure of `test_call_grobid_extractor_api_request_error` and context approaching limit (was 50% before task resumption, currently 34% after).
- **Context**: Attempting Green phase for `call_grobid_extractor` API error handling. Test mocks `http_client.make_async_request` to raise `httpx.RequestError`.
- **Issue**: The test fails with `AssertionError: assert {'metadata': ...} is None`. The function does not return `None` as expected when the `RequestError` is raised; instead, it proceeds and returns placeholder data.
- **Attempts**:
    1. Added specific `except httpx.RequestError` block returning `None`. (Failed)
    2. Restructured `try...except` blocks to isolate network call. (Failed)
    3. Ensured general `except Exception` block returns `None`. (Failed)
- **Analysis**: The exception raised by the mock's `side_effect` doesn't seem to be caught correctly by the `except` block in the `async` function `call_grobid_extractor`. The exact reason is unclear - potentially an issue with async exception handling, the mocking strategy, or the `try...except` structure interaction.
- **Self-Correction**: Multiple attempts to fix the code logic based on the test failure were unsuccessful.
- **Context %**: 34% (previously 50%)
- **Recommendation**: Invoke Early Return. Suggest `debug` mode investigate the exception handling discrepancy in `call_grobid_extractor` or refine the mocking strategy for `test_call_grobid_extractor_api_request_error`.
### [2025-04-28 14:30:10] - User Intervention: Clarification on Test Scope Discrepancy
- **Trigger:** User message following Early Return invocation.
- **Context:** Early Return was invoked due to `test_get_db_pool_failure` failing during verification, contradicting `debug` mode's report.
- **Action:** User suggested the discrepancy might be due to TDD running the full test file (`pytest tests/data_access/test_db_layer.py`) while `debug` mode likely ran only the specific test (`pytest tests/data_access/test_db_layer.py::test_get_db_pool_failure`).
- **Rationale:** Test interactions within a file could cause a test to fail when run as part of the suite, even if it passes in isolation.
- **Outcome:** Acknowledged feedback. Will re-attempt verification targeting only the specific test.
- **Follow-up:** Execute `pytest tests/data_access/test_db_layer.py::test_get_db_pool_failure`. Log results. If it passes, proceed with original task (testing `text_processing.py`), noting the interaction issue. If it fails, re-invoke Early Return. Also, monitor high context size (currently ~139%).

---
### [2025-04-28 14:28:05] - Early Return: Persistent Contradictory Test Failure
- **Trigger:** Second consecutive failure of `pytest tests/data_access/test_db_layer.py::test_get_db_pool_failure` during verification, despite debug mode reporting it fixed.
- **Context:** Attempting to resume TDD task after debug mode intervention. Re-synced Memory Bank which confirmed debug mode's report of test passing. Re-ran verification test.
- **Action:** Executed `pytest tests/data_access/test_db_layer.py`. Test failed again. Invoking Early Return.
- **Rationale:** The test `test_get_db_pool_failure` is persistently failing in this environment, directly contradicting the latest report from `debug` mode ([2025-04-28 13:24:10]). This indicates a fundamental, unresolved issue (potentially environment-related, code state mismatch, or a deeper mocking problem) that prevents reliable testing. Proceeding is impossible under these conditions. Context size is acceptable (25%), but the blocker is intractable.
- **Outcome:** Halting TDD task execution.
- **Follow-up:** Recommend SPARC intervention to resolve the environmental/state discrepancy or assign a different mode (perhaps `devops` or `debug` again with specific instructions to verify environment consistency) to definitively resolve the `test_get_db_pool_failure` blocker. [Ref: Issue-ID: TDD-DBPOOL-FAIL-20250428]

---
### [2025-04-28 13:19:45] - Critical Evaluation: Failed Verification of Debug Fix
- **Trigger:** Running `pytest tests/data_access/test_db_layer.py` as per task instructions to verify the fix for `test_get_db_pool_failure`.
- **Context:** Task brief and `activeContext.md` indicated `debug` mode successfully fixed the test in commit `e5dfc68`. Previous feedback logs detail extensive issues with mocking this specific test.
- **Action:** Executed `pytest tests/data_access/test_db_layer.py`.
- **Rationale:** Standard procedure to verify fixes before proceeding.
- **Outcome:** Test `test_get_db_pool_failure` FAILED with `Failed: DID NOT RAISE <class 'ConnectionError'>`. This directly contradicts the reported fix. The underlying mocking issue persists.
- **Follow-up:** Halting TDD task. Delegating back to `debug` mode via `new_task` to re-investigate the persistent failure and the discrepancy in reporting. The test must pass reliably before other modules can be tested. [Ref: Issue-ID: TDD-DBPOOL-FAIL-20250428]

---
### [2025-04-28 12:23:49] - User Intervention: Insufficient Detail in Early Return

**Trigger:** User denied `attempt_completion` for Early Return.
**Context:** Invoked Early Return due to persistent failure of `test_get_db_pool_failure` and high context.
**Action:** User requested a more detailed Early Return message for better handover.
**Rationale:** The initial message summarized the blocker but lacked specifics on attempts and state needed for seamless continuation by another mode or user.
**Outcome:** Will provide a more detailed `attempt_completion` message.
**Follow-up:** Ensure future Early Return messages include: specific test/function failing, summary of distinct debugging attempts, relevant file paths, current context percentage, and clear, actionable recommendations for next steps (e.g., specific debugging approaches, delegation targets).

---
### [2025-04-28 12:21:16] - Early Return: Persistent Test Failure & High Context

**Trigger:** Persistent failure of `tests/data_access/test_db_layer.py::test_get_db_pool_failure` and context size reaching 53%.
**Context:** Attempting to fix the test mocking for database connection pool initialization failure. Multiple strategies attempted (`apply_diff`, `write_to_file`, different patch targets, `try/except` vs `pytest.raises`, mocking constructor vs connection CM entry).
**Action:** Invoking Early Return clause.
**Rationale:** The test consistently fails with `AssertionError: ConnectionError was not raised`, indicating the mocked exception (`psycopg.OperationalError`) is not being caught and re-raised as `ConnectionError` by the `get_db_pool` function's `except` block, despite the source code appearing correct. The exact cause of the mocking interaction failure is unclear after several attempts. High context size (53%) also risks degraded performance.
**Outcome:** Halting task execution.
**Follow-up:** Recommend investigation by `debug` mode or restarting the task with a fresh context to analyze the mocking interaction in `test_get_db_pool_failure` more deeply.
