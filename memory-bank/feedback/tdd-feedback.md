### [2025-04-28 12:23:49] - User Intervention: Insufficient Detail in Early Return

**Trigger:** User denied `attempt_completion` for Early Return.
**Context:** Invoked Early Return due to persistent failure of `test_get_db_pool_failure` and high context.
**Action:** User requested a more detailed Early Return message for better handover.
**Rationale:** The initial message summarized the blocker but lacked specifics on attempts and state needed for seamless continuation by another mode or user.
**Outcome:** Will provide a more detailed `attempt_completion` message.
**Follow-up:** Ensure future Early Return messages include: specific test/function failing, summary of distinct debugging attempts, relevant file paths, current context percentage, and clear, actionable recommendations for next steps (e.g., specific debugging approaches, delegation targets).

### [2025-04-28 12:21:16] - Early Return: Persistent Test Failure & High Context

**Trigger:** Persistent failure of `tests/data_access/test_db_layer.py::test_get_db_pool_failure` and context size reaching 53%.
**Context:** Attempting to fix the test mocking for database connection pool initialization failure. Multiple strategies attempted (`apply_diff`, `write_to_file`, different patch targets, `try/except` vs `pytest.raises`, mocking constructor vs connection CM entry).
**Action:** Invoking Early Return clause.
**Rationale:** The test consistently fails with `AssertionError: ConnectionError was not raised`, indicating the mocked exception (`psycopg.OperationalError`) is not being caught and re-raised as `ConnectionError` by the `get_db_pool` function's `except` block, despite the source code appearing correct. The exact cause of the mocking interaction failure is unclear after several attempts. High context size (53%) also risks degraded performance.
**Outcome:** Halting task execution.
**Follow-up:** Recommend investigation by `debug` mode or restarting the task with a fresh context to analyze the mocking interaction in `test_get_db_pool_failure` more deeply.

# TDD Mode Feedback Log
<!-- Entries below should be added reverse chronologically (newest first) -->

### [2025-04-28 09:56:23] - Early Return Invoked
- **Trigger**: User instruction during TDD cycle for `mcp_utils.py`.
- **Context**: Task was to implement unit/integration tests for `src/philograph/`. Tests for `config.py`, `utils/file_utils.py`, `utils/http_client.py`, and `utils/mcp_utils.py` were completed successfully. Dependencies (`pytest-dotenv`, `pytest-httpx`, `h2`) were added. Minor code fixes were applied (`file_utils.py` import, `test_http_client.py` assertion). Context size ~37%.
- **Action**: Halting TDD task as instructed.
- **Rationale**: User requested early return to address "poor version control practices and the git debt".
- **Outcome**: TDD task paused before testing `utils/text_processing.py`.
- **Follow-up**: Awaiting instructions or task delegation to address version control.
