### Task Completion: Fixed Syntax Errors in `tests/api/test_main.py` - [2025-05-01 21:04:38]
- **Issue**: Persistent `SyntaxError`s and file corruption in `tests/api/test_main.py` blocking TDD progress [Ref: TDD Feedback 2025-05-01 21:00:00].
- **Diagnosis**: Read file content (`read_file` lines 1-500, 501-1025). Identified widespread issues: duplicate imports, structural corruption (nested function definitions), incomplete functions, duplicate function definitions, duplicate assertions. Likely caused by previous failed `apply_diff` attempts.
- **Fix**: Used `write_to_file` to overwrite the entire `tests/api/test_main.py` with reconstructed, corrected content (985 lines). Fixes included removing duplicates, correcting structure, and completing function definitions.
- **Verification**: Ran `sudo docker-compose exec philograph-backend pytest tests/api/test_main.py`. Result: `41 passed, 6 warnings`. Confirmed syntax errors resolved and tests are collectible.
- **Files Affected**: `tests/api/test_main.py`
- **Next Steps**: Commit fix, use `attempt_completion`. Recommend TDD run.
- **Related Issues**: [Ref: TDD Feedback 2025-05-01 21:00:00], [Ref: Issue-ID: API-TEST-SYNTAX-CORRUPTION-20250501]
### Early Return: Context Limit &amp; CLI Test Blocker - [2025-05-01 19:37:24]
- **Trigger**: Context size reached 45%, approaching the ~40-50% threshold for Early Return, and the remaining blocker is within the CLI test suite.
- **Blocker**: CLI tests (`tests/cli/test_cli_main.py::test_search_*`) are failing due to issues with mocking (`make_api_request` not called) and exit code handling (`SystemExit(1)` not resulting in exit code 1 in the test runner).
- **Progress**:
    - Applied workaround in `src/philograph/search/service.py` to truncate embeddings received from LiteLLM proxy, resolving the `ValueError: Received query embedding with incorrect dimension`.
    - Fixed SQL query in `src/philograph/data_access/db_layer.py` to use a literal for the vector dimension cast (`::vector(768)`), resolving the `Database search failed: type modifiers must be simple constants or identifiers` error.
    - Verification via `pytest` shows backend errors are resolved, but CLI tests now fail.
- **Analysis**: The original backend bug [Ref: Issue-ID: CLI-API-500-ERRORS-DIMENSION] appears fixed. The remaining failures are specific to the CLI test suite's interaction with `typer.testing.CliRunner` and `unittest.mock`.
- **Self-Correction**: N/A (Followed structured diagnosis, context limit reached).
- **Context %**: 45% (Manually calculated: ~453k / 1,000,000)
- **Recommendations**:
    1.  **Invoke Early Return Clause.**
    2.  **Delegate via `new_task` to `tdd` mode**: Objective: "Fix failing CLI search tests in `tests/cli/test_cli_main.py` related to mocking and exit code handling. [Ref: Debug Feedback 2025-05-01 19:37:24]".
    3.  **Next Steps for TDD**:
        *   Investigate why `make_api_request` mock is not being called in success/empty tests. Check if the command exits prematurely within the `runner.invoke` context.
        *   Investigate why `SystemExit(1)` raised by the mock in `test_search_api_error` results in `result.exit_code == 0`. Explore alternative ways to assert expected error exits with `typer.testing.CliRunner`.
        *   Refactor tests as needed to correctly mock dependencies and assert behavior.
### Early Return: Context Limit Exceeded - 2025-05-01 19:28:03
- **Trigger**: Context size reached 99% (994,773 tokens), exceeding the ~40-50% threshold for Early Return.
- **Blocker**: High context size prevents further reliable tool use and analysis.
- **Progress**:
    - Resumed investigation of [Issue-ID: CLI-API-500-ERRORS].
    - Confirmed syntax errors in `src/philograph/search/service.py` were fixed.
    - Restarted Docker services (`sudo docker-compose down && sudo docker-compose up -d --build`).
    - Re-ran failing tests (`pytest tests/cli/test_cli_main.py -k test_search_`), which still failed but with a different error: `500 - {"detail":"Embedding generation failed (Processing Error)"}`.
    - Checked `philograph-backend` logs, confirmed `httpx.ConnectError` was gone, but a new `ValueError: Received query embedding with incorrect dimension (3072)` appeared in `src/philograph/search/service.py`.
    - Checked `litellm-proxy` logs, showing successful startup but no incoming requests initially.
    - Tested network connectivity (`ping`, `nc`) from `philograph-backend` to `litellm-proxy`, confirming basic network and TCP port reachability.
    - Hypothesized a Python/`httpx`-specific DNS resolution issue.
    - Tested hypothesis by temporarily changing `LITELLM_PROXY_URL` in `src/philograph/config.py` to use the IP address (`172.23.0.3`).
    - Restarted services and re-ran tests. The `ConnectError` was resolved, but the `ValueError` (dimension mismatch) persisted.
    - Reverted the IP address change in `src/philograph/config.py`.
- **Analysis**: The root cause shifted from a connection error to an embedding dimension mismatch. `litellm-proxy` is returning 3072 dimensions, while the backend expects 768. Potential causes: `litellm_config.yaml` misconfiguration, LiteLLM/Vertex AI dimension handling issue, or backend validation logic error.
- **Self-Correction**: N/A (Issue evolved, previous steps were logical).
- **Context %**: 99%
- **Recommendations**:
    1.  **Delegate via `new_task`**: Create a new task for `debug` mode with the objective: "Investigate and fix the embedding dimension mismatch (Expected 768, Got 3072) related to `litellm-proxy` and `philo-embed` model [Ref: Issue-ID: CLI-API-500-ERRORS, Debug Feedback 2025-05-01 19:28:03]".
    2.  **Next Steps for New Task**:
        *   Check `litellm_config.yaml` for the `philo-embed` model definition and dimension settings. (File path likely `/app/litellm_config.yaml` inside the `litellm-proxy` container, or mounted from the host).
        *   Verify the dimension check logic in `src/philograph/search/service.py` (around line 60).
        *   Check `litellm-proxy` logs again for errors related to the embedding request processing itself (`sudo docker-compose logs litellm-proxy`).
        *   If necessary, inspect the `litellm` library code or documentation regarding Vertex AI dimension handling.
### Early Return - High Context (74%) & Syntax Error - [2025-05-01 15:43:00]
- **Trigger**: Context size reached 74% after `insert_content` operation resulted in Pylance syntax errors.
- **Context**: Investigating `500 - {"detail":"Search failed due to unexpected embedding error"}` [Ref: Issue-ID: CLI-API-500-ERRORS]. Confirmed error is linked to using real GCP credentials (`/home/loganrooks/.secrets/philograph-gcp-key.json`) vs dummy key. Attempted to add logging to `src/philograph/search/service.py` (around line 40) to inspect `litellm-proxy` response.
- **Issue**: The `insert_content` operation introduced syntax errors (indentation, try/except structure) reported by Pylance. Context limit (74%) prevents safely applying fixes and continuing verification.
- **Attempts**:
    1. Analyzed API (`api/main.py`) and Service (`search/service.py`) code.
    2. Checked `litellm-proxy` logs (showed 200 OK).
    3. Verified `.env` and `litellm_config.yaml`.
    4. Switched `.env` between dummy and real GCP key, confirming the error change and linking the issue to the real key/mount.
    5. Attempted `insert_content` to add logging to `search_service.py`.
- **Analysis**: The root cause of the original "unexpected embedding error" is highly likely related to the real GCP credentials file access, validity, or permissions within the `litellm-proxy` container. The immediate blocker is the syntax error introduced by `insert_content` and the critical context level.
- **Self-Correction**: Invoking Early Return Clause due to context limit and inability to proceed with fixing the introduced syntax error.
- **Context %**: 74% (Manually calculated: ~744k / 1,000,000)
- **Recommendation**: Invoke Early Return. Delegate to `debug` (new instance) or `code` mode via `new_task` to:
    1.  **Fix Syntax Errors:** Correct the syntax errors in `src/philograph/search/service.py` around line 40, ensuring the added logging (`logger.debug(f"LiteLLM raw response status: {response.status_code}")`, `logger.debug(f"LiteLLM raw response text: {response.text}")`, etc.) is correctly placed within the `try` block before the `response.json()` call.
    2.  **Restart Services:** Run `sudo docker-compose down && sudo docker-compose up -d --build`.
    3.  **Reproduce & Verify:** Run the failing search tests: `sudo docker-compose exec philograph-backend pytest tests/cli/test_cli_main.py -k test_search_`.
    4.  **Analyze Logs:** Check `philograph-backend` logs for the newly added debug output from `search_service.py` and re-check `litellm-proxy` logs (`sudo docker-compose logs litellm-proxy`) for any subtle errors related to authentication or the specific request.
    5.  **Implement Final Fix:** Based on log analysis (e.g., specific error from Vertex AI within the response text, permission error), implement the necessary fix. This might involve adjusting the GCP key file mounting/permissions, correcting LiteLLM configuration, or refining error handling in `search_service.py`.
    6.  **Verify Fix:** Re-run the search tests to confirm they pass.
    7.  **Update Memory Bank & Complete:** Document the final fix and verification in the Memory Bank and use `attempt_completion`.

### Debug Task Summary - DB Connection Fix - [2025-05-01 13:31:41]
- **Issue**: Persistent DB connection failure from `philograph-backend` to `db` container, manifesting as `[Errno -2] Name or service not known` or `PoolTimeout`, leading to `SIGKILL`. [Ref: Issue-ID: PYTEST-SIGKILL-DB-CONN-20250430]
- **Diagnostics**:
    - Added `postgresql-client` to `Dockerfile`.
    - Enabled `psycopg` DEBUG logging via `src/philograph/config.py`.
    - Ran isolation test (`docker compose exec ... python -c "..."`).
    - Analyzed logs: Identified `failed to resolve host 'Lsr@db'` error.
    - Checked `.env`: Confirmed `DB_PASSWORD="190297@Lsr"`.
- **Root Cause**: Unencoded special character ('@') in `DB_PASSWORD` caused `psycopg` to misinterpret the hostname in the connection URL.
- **Fix**: Modified `src/philograph/config.py` to URL-encode the password using `urllib.parse.quote_plus`.
- **Verification**: Re-ran isolation test, which passed successfully, confirming connection establishment.
- **Commit**: 537e2d7
- **Files Affected**: `Dockerfile`, `src/philograph/config.py`
### Intervention Log - [2025-04-30 13:47:41]
- **Trigger**: User feedback on `attempt_completion` message.
- **Context**: Debug mode invoked Early Return due to intractable DB blocker. User previously noted discrepancy in context reporting.
- **Action**: User noted context window size dropped significantly (~135k / 14%).
- **Rationale**: Acknowledging observation of context size fluctuation.
- **Outcome**: Early Return decision remains justified by the intractable nature of the blocker.
- **Follow-up**: Proceeding with `attempt_completion` for Early Return.
### Intervention Log - [2025-04-30 13:43:37]
- **Trigger**: User feedback on `attempt_completion` message.
- **Context**: Debug mode invoked Early Return due to intractable DB blocker and reported context percentage.
- **Action**: User noted that context percentage calculation should divide tokens by 1,000,000, resulting in a lower actual percentage (e.g., ~24% instead of ~43%).
- **Rationale**: Acknowledging correct calculation method.
- **Outcome**: Early Return decision remains justified by the intractable nature of the blocker, even with lower context percentage. Will adjust future context reporting if possible.
- **Follow-up**: Proceeding with `attempt_completion` for Early Return.
### Early Return - Intractable DB Blocker &amp; Context Limit - [2025-04-30 13:31:58]
- **Trigger**: Persistent failure to initialize `psycopg_pool` and context size reaching 43%.
- **Context**: Investigating `SIGKILL` / `PoolTimeout` / `[Errno -2] Name or service not known` during DB connection attempts from `philograph-backend` to `db`. [Ref: Issue-ID: PYTEST-SIGKILL-DB-CONN-20250430]
- **Issue**: `psycopg_pool` fails to initialize, reporting `[Errno -2] Name or service not known` or timing out, even when using the DB container's direct IP address (`172.20.0.2`) and after correcting pool initialization (`await pool.open()`). This occurs despite successful OS-level hostname resolution (`ping db`) and TCP port checks (`nc -zv db 5432`). DB logs show no connection errors.
- **Attempts**:
    1. Verified `SIGKILL` / `Name or service not known` error persists after adding build dependencies (`libpq-dev`, `build-essential`). [Ref: Debug Log 2025-04-30 13:03:17]
    2. Added network tools (`iputils-ping`, `telnet`, `netcat-openbsd`) to `Dockerfile` after `apt-get install` failed in running container. Rebuilt image. [Ref: Debug Log 2025-04-30 13:04:56]
    3. Verified network connectivity: `ping db` succeeded. [Ref: Debug Log 2025-04-30 13:27:02]
    4. Verified port reachability: `nc -zv db 5432` succeeded. [Ref: Debug Log 2025-04-30 13:27:16]
    5. Checked `db` container logs: No connection errors found. [Ref: Debug Log 2025-04-30 13:27:29]
    6. Verified `docker-compose.yml`: Network (`philograph-net`), service names (`db`), dependencies (`depends_on`), env vars (`DB_HOST=db`) appear correct. [Ref: Debug Log 2025-04-30 13:27:42]
    7. Verified `.env`: DB credentials/host/port match `docker-compose.yml`. [Ref: Debug Log 2025-04-30 13:27:57]
    8. Verified `config.py`: `ASYNC_DATABASE_URL` construction is correct (`postgresql://...`). [Ref: Debug Log 2025-04-30 13:28:06]
    9. Modified `db_layer.py` to use `await pool.open()` instead of deprecated `open=True`. Re-ran isolation test: Failed (`PoolTimeout`, `Name or service not known`). [Ref: Debug Log 2025-04-30 13:29:43]
   10. Modified `config.py` to use direct IP `172.20.0.2`. Re-ran isolation test: Failed (`PoolTimeout`, `Name or service not known`). [Ref: Debug Log 2025-04-30 13:31:11]
   11. Checked `/etc/resolv.conf` in container: Standard Docker DNS (`127.0.0.11`). [Ref: Debug Log 2025-04-30 13:31:30]
   12. Reverted `config.py` to use hostname `db`. [Ref: Debug Log 2025-04-30 13:31:58]
- **Analysis**: The blocker is an intractable failure within the Python/`psycopg_pool` environment to connect to the database, despite network connectivity and configuration appearing correct. The contradictory "Name or service not known" error when using an IP address is particularly indicative of a deeper issue.
- **Self-Correction**: Invoking Early Return Clause due to intractable blocker and context limit (43%).
- **Context %**: 43%
- **Recommendation**: Invoke Early Return. Delegate to `debug` or `devops` via `new_task` for deeper investigation into the Python/`psycopg` connection failure within the Docker environment. Suggestions:
    - Enable verbose logging within `psycopg`.
    - Use `strace` on the Python process during connection attempts.
    - Investigate container network stack/Python interactions (e.g., IPv6).
    - Test alternative libraries (`asyncpg`) or `psycopg` versions.
    - Create a minimal `psycopg`-only (no pool) connection script.
    Provide link to this feedback entry and relevant Memory Bank sections (`debug.md`, `activeContext.md`). [Ref: Issue-ID: PYTEST-SIGKILL-DB-CONN-20250430]
### Early Return Invoked - [2025-04-30 12:41:20]
- **Trigger**: User instruction + High Context Usage (62%) approaching critical limits.
- **Context**: Debugging persistent `psycopg` connection failure from `philograph-backend` to `db` container. Initial attempts (forcing IPv4, switching to `psycopg[pool]`) failed. The `psycopg[pool]` attempt caused a build failure (`ImportError: no pq wrapper available`), indicating missing system build dependencies (`libpq-dev`, `build-essential`).
- **Action**:
    1. Reverted `requirements.txt` to `psycopg[binary,pool]`.
    2. Modified `Dockerfile` to install `libpq-dev` and `build-essential` via `apt-get` before `pip install`.
    3. Successfully rebuilt `philograph-backend` image and restarted all services (`docker compose build philograph-backend && docker compose down && docker compose up -d`). Services appear healthy.
    4. Invoked Early Return as per user instruction and context management rules *before* re-running the connection test.
- **Rationale**: High context usage (62%) risks degraded performance and potential errors. Following user instruction and protocol to ensure stable operation.
- **Outcome**: Debugging paused. System state includes updated `Dockerfile` and `requirements.txt` (reverted). Services are running with the latest build.
- **Follow-up**: A new task should be created to continue debugging by re-running the Python isolation test (`docker compose exec -T philograph-backend python -c "import asyncio; from philograph.data_access import db_layer; from philograph import config; print(f'Attempting to connect to: {config.ASYNC_DATABASE_URL}'); asyncio.run(db_layer.get_db_pool())"`) to verify if adding system dependencies resolved the connection issue. If the issue persists, proceed with network tool diagnostics (`ping`, `nc`, `telnet`) inside the container and checking `db` logs as originally planned. [See Task: Deeper Investigation: Database Connection Failure (psycopg/Docker) - YYYY-MM-DD HH:MM:SS]
### Early Return - Intractable DB Connection Blocker &amp; Context Limit - [2025-04-30 07:31:51]
- **Trigger**: Persistent failure to initialize `psycopg_pool` and context size reaching 52%.
- **Context**: Investigating `SIGKILL` during `pytest` in `philograph-backend`. Initial hypothesis of OOM during FastAPI app import/lifespan.
- **Issue**: `psycopg_pool` fails to initialize, reporting `[Errno -2] Name or service not known` or timing out, even when using the DB container's direct IP address (`172.20.0.2`). This occurs both during `pytest` and direct Python execution within the container. OS-level hostname resolution (`getent hosts db`) works correctly. The original `SIGKILL` is likely a symptom of resource exhaustion caused by these failed connection attempts.
- **Attempts**:
    1. Instrumented `api/main.py` lifespan with `tracemalloc` - `SIGKILL` occurred before logs.
    2. Instrumented `api/main.py` imports with `tracemalloc` - `ConnectionError` occurred before logs.
    3. Isolated `db_layer.get_db_pool()` call via `docker compose exec python -c "..."` - Failed with `SIGKILL` after logging `Name or service not known`.
    4. Verified OS hostname resolution (`getent hosts db`) - Succeeded.
    5. Temporarily hardcoded DB IP in `config.py` - Isolation test still failed with `PoolTimeout` / `Name or service not known`.
    6. Reverted diagnostic changes.
- **Analysis**: The blocker is a fundamental inability of the Python/`psycopg` stack within the container to establish a connection to the DB service, despite correct Docker networking and configuration. The reason for this failure (and the potentially misleading error message) is unclear and requires deeper investigation beyond standard code/config checks (e.g., Python network stack internals, IPv6/IPv4 issues, library-specific behavior in container).
- **Self-Correction**: Invoking Early Return Clause due to intractable blocker and context limit (52%).
- **Context %**: 52%
- **Recommendation**: Invoke Early Return. Delegate to `debug` or `devops` via `new_task` for deeper investigation into the Python/`psycopg` connection failure within the Docker environment. Suggestions:
    - Check for IPv6 issues (e.g., try disabling IPv6 in the container or forcing IPv4 in connection string if possible).
    - Use lower-level network tools within the container (if possible, add `net-tools`, `iputils-ping`, `curl` to the image temporarily) to test connectivity directly to `172.20.0.2:5432`.
    - Investigate `psycopg` / `psycopg_pool` specific configurations or known issues related to Docker environments.
    - Check PostgreSQL server logs (`docker compose logs db`) for any connection attempt logs or errors from the backend's IP.
    Provide link to this feedback entry and relevant Memory Bank sections (`debug.md`, `activeContext.md`). [Ref: Issue-ID: PYTEST-SIGKILL-DB-CONN-20250430]
### Early Return - Context Limit Exceeded (55%) - [2025-04-29 09:26:29]
- **Trigger**: Context size reached 55% after applying fixes for `/search` and `/ingest` 500 errors.
- **Context**: Investigating backend 500 errors [Ref: Issue-ID: CLI-API-500-ERRORS] [Ref: Issue-ID: CLI-API-500-ERRORS-INGEST]. Identified root causes: `/search` error due to `litellm-proxy` failing to load invalid GCP credentials file (`/dev/null` specified in `.env`); `/ingest` error due to API handler returning 500 instead of 404 for "File not found".
- **Issue**: Context limit exceeded before verification steps could be performed.
- **Attempts**:
    1. Created dummy JSON file `dummy-gcp-key.json`.
    2. Updated `.env` to point `GOOGLE_APPLICATION_CREDENTIALS` to `dummy-gcp-key.json`.
    3. Modified `/ingest` handler in `src/philograph/api/main.py` to return 404 for "File not found" errors.
- **Analysis**: Fixes address the identified root causes. The `/search` error should be resolved as `litellm-proxy` can now parse the (dummy) credentials file. The `/ingest` error should now correctly return a 404. Verification requires restarting services and re-running tests.
- **Self-Correction**: Following `context_management` protocol to invoke Early Return due to context limit.
- **Context %**: 55%
- **Recommendation**: Invoke Early Return. Suggest SPARC create a `new_task` (likely for `tdd` or `debug`) to:
    1. **Restart Docker services:** Run `docker compose down && docker compose up -d --build` to apply the `.env` change and code modifications.
    2. **Verify `/search` fix:** Run `docker compose exec philograph-backend pytest tests/cli/test_main.py -k "test_search_success_query_only"`. Expect the test to pass or fail with a *different* error (e.g., actual embedding API error if dummy key isn't sufficient, or DB error). Check `litellm-proxy` logs (`docker compose logs litellm-proxy`) for any remaining auth errors.
    3. **Verify `/ingest` fix:** Run `docker compose exec philograph-backend pytest tests/cli/test_main.py -k "test_ingest_success"`. Expect the test to fail with a 404 Not Found error from the API (because `dummy_test_doc.pdf` doesn't exist), which would indicate the fix worked correctly (the test itself needs adjustment later to handle the 404 or use a valid file/mock).
    4. **Proceed based on results:** If tests pass/fail as expected, the immediate 500 errors are resolved. Further debugging or test adjustments may be needed. If unexpected errors occur, continue debugging.
    Provide link to this feedback entry and relevant Memory Bank sections (`debug.md`, `activeContext.md`) for context handover.
### Early Return - Context Limit (60%) & Network Verification Blocker - [2025-04-29 05:03:55]
- **Trigger**: Context size reached 60% after fixing `litellm-proxy` startup but being unable to directly verify network connectivity.
- **Context**: Investigating `litellm-proxy` connection issues blocking `/search` CLI tests [Ref: Issue: CLI-API-500-ERRORS]. Identified and fixed root cause of proxy crash: incorrect YAML indentation in `litellm_config.yaml` (comments indented under `general_settings: {}`). Proxy service logs now indicate successful startup after applying the fix and restarting the service.
- **Issue/Blocker**: Cannot directly verify network connectivity from `philograph-backend` to `litellm-proxy` using standard tools (`ping`, `curl`) as they are not installed in the backend container image. The next logical verification step requires running application code (e.g., CLI tests) that attempts to contact the proxy.
- **Attempts**:
    1. Fixed `litellm_config.yaml` indentation.
    2. Restarted `litellm-proxy` service.
    3. Verified proxy logs show successful startup.
    4. Attempted `ping litellm-proxy` from backend container (failed: command not found).
    5. Attempted `curl http://litellm-proxy:4000/` from backend container (failed: command not found).
- **Analysis**: The proxy crash seems resolved. The remaining uncertainty is whether the backend can *reach* the now-running proxy over the Docker network (`philograph-net`). The original `ConnectError` seen in backend logs during tests should be resolved if connectivity is working.
- **Self-Correction**: Following `context_management` and `error_handling_protocol` to invoke Early Return due to high context and the verification blocker.
- **Context %**: 60%
- **Recommendation**: Invoke Early Return. Suggest SPARC create a `new_task` for `tdd` mode to:
    1. **Run specific failing CLI tests:** Execute tests that trigger communication with the proxy, specifically the `/search` tests (e.g., `pytest tests/cli/test_main.py -k test_search_success_query_only`).
    2. **Monitor backend logs:** Check `docker compose logs philograph-backend` during the test run for the *absence* of `ConnectError` related to `litellm-proxy:4000`.
    3. **Proceed based on logs:**
        *   If `ConnectError` is gone: The proxy connectivity issue is likely resolved. TDD can proceed with debugging any *new* errors revealed by the tests (e.g., issues with the embedding API call itself, response parsing, etc.).
        *   If `ConnectError` persists: Delegate back to `debug` or `devops` to investigate the Docker network (`philograph-net`) configuration and communication more deeply (e.g., using `docker network inspect`, checking container IPs, potentially adding tools to the image temporarily if necessary).
    Provide link to this feedback entry and relevant Memory Bank sections (`debug.md`, `activeContext.md`) for context handover. [Ref: Issue-ID: CLI-API-500-ERRORS]
### Early Return - Context Limit & Persistent Blocker - [2025-04-29 04:58:20]
- **Trigger**: Context size reached 68% after multiple failed attempts to resolve `/search` 500 errors.
- **Context**: Investigating backend 500 errors reported by TDD. Identified and attempted fixes for Docker networking (`docker-compose.yml`), DB schema initialization (`api/main.py`), and LiteLLM proxy config (`litellm_config.yaml`). Recreated services via `docker compose down && docker compose up -d --build`.
- **Issue**: `/search` tests still fail with `Embedding generation failed (Request Error)`, indicating the `litellm-proxy` service is still unreachable or not running correctly. `/ingest` tests still fail due to invalid test path. Context size is critically high.
- **Attempts**:
    1. Added explicit network to `docker-compose.yml`.
    2. Enabled DB schema initialization in `api/main.py`.
    3. Corrected `litellm_config.yaml` (`pass` statement).
    4. Recreated Docker services using `docker compose down && docker compose up -d --build`.
- **Analysis**: The persistent failure to connect to `litellm-proxy` despite configuration fixes suggests a deeper issue with the proxy service itself or its interaction with the environment/network setup that wasn't immediately apparent from the logs or config files. Further investigation would require more detailed inspection of the proxy's internal state or potentially trying alternative configurations/versions. The `/ingest` issue is confirmed as a test setup problem.
- **Self-Correction**: Following `context_management` and `error_handling_protocol` to invoke Early Return due to high context and persistent blocker.
- **Context %**: 68%
- **Recommendation**: Invoke Early Return. Suggest SPARC create a `new_task` for `debug` (or potentially `devops`) to:
    1. **Focus solely on the `litellm-proxy` service:** Check its logs again after the latest `docker compose up`. If it's still crashing, investigate the `AttributeError` further (perhaps related to LiteLLM version or other config interactions). If it's running but unreachable, investigate Docker networking more deeply (e.g., `docker network inspect philograph-net`, check container IPs, try pinging).
    2. **Separately, fix the `/ingest` test paths:** Once the `/search` blocker is resolved, create a separate task (likely for `tdd` or `code`) to correct the invalid path (`some/document.pdf`) used in `tests/cli/test_main.py` for the `ingest` tests. A valid path within the mounted `/app/data/source_documents` volume or a mocked filesystem should be used.

### Intervention Log - [2025-04-28 13:03:28]
- **Trigger:** User message questioning `apply_diff` success and subsequent `pytest` validity.
- **Context:** Multiple `apply_diff` failures reported, followed by `pytest` execution and conclusion of test failure.
- **Action:** Acknowledged error in proceeding without confirming `apply_diff` success. Will re-verify file state and retry `apply_diff` before re-running `pytest`.
- **Rationale:** User correctly identified a flaw in the debugging process. Need to ensure code changes are applied before testing.
- **Outcome:** Correcting process.
- **Follow-up:** Re-read file, re-apply diff, re-run pytest.
# Debug Mode Feedback Log

### Intervention Log: [2025-04-28 12:57:30]
- **Trigger**: User question ("are you sure this is the issue? Why can't you try searching this up?") after multiple failed attempts to fix `test_get_db_pool_failure`.
- **Context**: Debug mode had concluded standard mocking strategies were insufficient and was preparing to finalize with a diagnosis.
- **Action**: Acknowledged user feedback, agreed to perform a web search for similar issues/solutions before finalizing diagnosis.
- **Rationale**: Exhausting available information sources (including web search) is appropriate before concluding a fix is complex.
- **Outcome**: Search initiated.
- **Follow-up**: Analyze search results and proceed accordingly.
