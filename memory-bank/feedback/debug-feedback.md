### Early Return - Context Limit Exceeded (55%) - [2025-04-29 09:26:29]
- **Trigger**: Context size reached 55% after applying fixes for `/search` and `/ingest` 500 errors.
- **Context**: Investigating backend 500 errors [Ref: Issue-ID: CLI-API-500-ERRORS] [Ref: Issue-ID: CLI-API-500-ERRORS-INGEST]. Identified root causes: `/search` error due to `litellm-proxy` failing to load invalid GCP credentials file (`/dev/null` specified in `.env`); `/ingest` error due to API handler returning 500 instead of 404 for "File not found".
- **Issue**: Context limit exceeded before verification steps could be performed.
- **Attempts**:
    1. Created dummy JSON file `dummy-gcp-key.json`.
    2. Updated `.env` to point `GOOGLE_APPLICATION_CREDENTIALS` to `dummy-gcp-key.json`.
    3. Modified `/ingest` handler in `src/philograph/api/main.py` to return 404 for "File not found" errors.
- **Analysis**: Fixes address the identified root causes. The `/search` error should be resolved as `litellm-proxy` can now parse the (dummy) credentials file. The `/ingest` error should now correctly return a 404. Verification requires restarting services and re-running tests.
- **Self-Correction**: Following `context_management` protocol to invoke Early Return due to context limit.
- **Context %**: 55%
- **Recommendation**: Invoke Early Return. Suggest SPARC create a `new_task` (likely for `tdd` or `debug`) to:
    1. **Restart Docker services:** Run `docker compose down && docker compose up -d --build` to apply the `.env` change and code modifications.
    2. **Verify `/search` fix:** Run `docker compose exec philograph-backend pytest tests/cli/test_main.py -k "test_search_success_query_only"`. Expect the test to pass or fail with a *different* error (e.g., actual embedding API error if dummy key isn't sufficient, or DB error). Check `litellm-proxy` logs (`docker compose logs litellm-proxy`) for any remaining auth errors.
    3. **Verify `/ingest` fix:** Run `docker compose exec philograph-backend pytest tests/cli/test_main.py -k "test_ingest_success"`. Expect the test to fail with a 404 Not Found error from the API (because `dummy_test_doc.pdf` doesn't exist), which would indicate the fix worked correctly (the test itself needs adjustment later to handle the 404 or use a valid file/mock).
    4. **Proceed based on results:** If tests pass/fail as expected, the immediate 500 errors are resolved. Further debugging or test adjustments may be needed. If unexpected errors occur, continue debugging.

### Early Return - Context Limit (60%) & Network Verification Blocker - [2025-04-29 05:03:55]
- **Trigger**: Context size reached 60% after fixing `litellm-proxy` startup but being unable to directly verify network connectivity.
- **Context**: Investigating `litellm-proxy` connection issues blocking `/search` CLI tests [Ref: Issue: CLI-API-500-ERRORS]. Identified and fixed root cause of proxy crash: incorrect YAML indentation in `litellm_config.yaml` (comments indented under `general_settings: {}`). Proxy service logs now indicate successful startup after applying the fix and restarting the service.
- **Issue/Blocker**: Cannot directly verify network connectivity from `philograph-backend` to `litellm-proxy` using standard tools (`ping`, `curl`) as they are not installed in the backend container image. The next logical verification step requires running application code (e.g., CLI tests) that attempts to contact the proxy.
- **Attempts**:
    1. Fixed `litellm_config.yaml` indentation.
    2. Restarted `litellm-proxy` service.
    3. Verified proxy logs show successful startup.
    4. Attempted `ping litellm-proxy` from backend container (failed: command not found).
    5. Attempted `curl http://litellm-proxy:4000/` from backend container (failed: command not found).
- **Analysis**: The proxy crash seems resolved. The remaining uncertainty is whether the backend can *reach* the now-running proxy over the Docker network (`philograph-net`). The original `ConnectError` seen in backend logs during tests should be resolved if connectivity is working.
- **Self-Correction**: Following `context_management` and `error_handling_protocol` to invoke Early Return due to high context and the verification blocker.
- **Context %**: 60%
- **Recommendation**: Invoke Early Return. Suggest SPARC create a `new_task` for `tdd` mode to:
    1. **Run specific failing CLI tests:** Execute tests that trigger communication with the proxy, specifically the `/search` tests (e.g., `pytest tests/cli/test_main.py -k test_search_success_query_only`).
    2. **Monitor backend logs:** Check `docker compose logs philograph-backend` during the test run for the *absence* of `ConnectError` related to `litellm-proxy:4000`.
    3. **Proceed based on logs:**
        *   If `ConnectError` is gone: The proxy connectivity issue is likely resolved. TDD can proceed with debugging any *new* errors revealed by the tests (e.g., issues with the embedding API call itself, response parsing, etc.).
        *   If `ConnectError` persists: Delegate back to `debug` or `devops` to investigate the Docker network (`philograph-net`) configuration and communication more deeply (e.g., using `docker network inspect`, checking container IPs, potentially adding tools to the image temporarily if necessary).

### Early Return - Context Limit & Persistent Blocker - [2025-04-29 04:58:20]
- **Trigger**: Context size reached 68% after multiple failed attempts to resolve `/search` 500 errors.
- **Context**: Investigating backend 500 errors reported by TDD. Identified and attempted fixes for Docker networking (`docker-compose.yml`), DB schema initialization (`api/main.py`), and LiteLLM proxy config (`litellm_config.yaml`). Recreated services via `docker compose down && docker compose up -d --build`.
- **Issue**: `/search` tests still fail with `Embedding generation failed (Request Error)`, indicating the `litellm-proxy` service is still unreachable or not running correctly. `/ingest` tests still fail due to invalid test path. Context size is critically high.
- **Attempts**:
    1. Added explicit network to `docker-compose.yml`.
    2. Enabled DB schema initialization in `api/main.py`.
    3. Corrected `litellm_config.yaml` (`pass` statement).
    4. Recreated Docker services using `docker compose down && docker compose up -d --build`.
- **Analysis**: The persistent failure to connect to `litellm-proxy` despite configuration fixes suggests a deeper issue with the proxy service itself or its interaction with the environment/network setup that wasn't immediately apparent from the logs or config files. Further investigation would require more detailed inspection of the proxy's internal state or potentially trying alternative configurations/versions. The `/ingest` issue is confirmed as a test setup problem.
- **Self-Correction**: Following `context_management` and `error_handling_protocol` to invoke Early Return due to high context and persistent blocker.
- **Context %**: 68%
- **Recommendation**: Invoke Early Return. Suggest SPARC create a `new_task` for `debug` (or potentially `devops`) to:
    1. **Focus solely on the `litellm-proxy` service:** Check its logs again after the latest `docker compose up`. If it's still crashing, investigate the `AttributeError` further (perhaps related to LiteLLM version or other config interactions). If it's running but unreachable, investigate Docker networking more deeply (e.g., `docker network inspect philograph-net`, check container IPs, try pinging).
    2. **Separately, fix the `/ingest` test paths:** Once the `/search` blocker is resolved, create a separate task (likely for `tdd` or `code`) to correct the invalid path (`some/document.pdf`) used in `tests/cli/test_main.py` for the `ingest` tests. A valid path within the mounted `/app/data/source_documents` volume or a mocked filesystem should be used.

### Intervention Log - [2025-04-28 13:03:28]
- **Trigger:** User message questioning `apply_diff` success and subsequent `pytest` validity.
- **Context:** Multiple `apply_diff` failures reported, followed by `pytest` execution and conclusion of test failure.
- **Action:** Acknowledged error in proceeding without confirming `apply_diff` success. Will re-verify file state and retry `apply_diff` before re-running `pytest`.
- **Rationale:** User correctly identified a flaw in the debugging process. Need to ensure code changes are applied before testing.
- **Outcome:** Correcting process.
- **Follow-up:** Re-read file, re-apply diff, re-run pytest.
# Debug Mode Feedback Log
<!-- Entries below should be added reverse chronologically (newest first) -->
### Intervention Log: [2025-04-28 12:57:30]
- **Trigger**: User question ("are you sure this is the issue? Why can't you try searching this up?") after multiple failed attempts to fix `test_get_db_pool_failure`.
- **Context**: Debug mode had concluded standard mocking strategies were insufficient and was preparing to finalize with a diagnosis.
- **Action**: Acknowledged user feedback, agreed to perform a web search for similar issues/solutions before finalizing diagnosis.
- **Rationale**: Exhausting available information sources (including web search) is appropriate before concluding a fix is complex.
- **Outcome**: Search initiated.
- **Follow-up**: Analyze search results and proceed accordingly.
