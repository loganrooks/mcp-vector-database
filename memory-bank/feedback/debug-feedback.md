### Intervention Log - [2025-04-28 13:03:28]
- **Trigger:** User message questioning `apply_diff` success and subsequent `pytest` validity.
- **Context:** Multiple `apply_diff` failures reported, followed by `pytest` execution and conclusion of test failure.
- **Action:** Acknowledged error in proceeding without confirming `apply_diff` success. Will re-verify file state and retry `apply_diff` before re-running `pytest`.
- **Rationale:** User correctly identified a flaw in the debugging process. Need to ensure code changes are applied before testing.
- **Outcome:** Correcting process.
- **Follow-up:** Re-read file, re-apply diff, re-run pytest.

### Intervention Log: [2025-04-28 12:57:30]
- **Trigger**: User question ("are you sure this is the issue? Why can't you try searching this up?") after multiple failed attempts to fix `test_get_db_pool_failure`.
- **Context**: Debug mode had concluded standard mocking strategies were insufficient and was preparing to finalize with a diagnosis.
- **Action**: Acknowledged user feedback, agreed to perform a web search for similar issues/solutions before finalizing diagnosis.
- **Rationale**: Exhausting available information sources (including web search) is appropriate before concluding a fix is complex.
- **Outcome**: Search initiated.
- **Follow-up**: Analyze search results and proceed accordingly.
