### Early Return: Context Limit Exceeded - [2025-04-29 17:57:30]
- **Trigger:** Context size reached 52% after reading implementation files and generating the status report.
- **Task:** Project State Analysis & Deviation Report.
- **Progress:**
    - Memory Bank initialized.
    - Reviewed planning documents (Specs v2.3, Arch, ADRs 001/004/008, Pseudocode).
    - Reviewed core implementation files (`src/philograph/api/main.py`, `cli/main.py`, `data_access/db_layer.py`, `ingestion/pipeline.py`, `search/service.py`, `acquisition/service.py`, `mcp/main.py`).
    - Generated the requested report: `docs/reports/project_status_review_2025-04-29.md`.
- **Blocker:** Context size limit (52%) prevents proceeding with Memory Bank updates before final completion.
- **Analysis:** Task involved reading numerous large documents and code files, leading to rapid context accumulation.
- **Self-Correction:** Adhering to Early Return protocol.
- **Context %:** 52%
- **Recommendations:** Handover to SPARC or user. The generated report is available, but Memory Bank updates were not performed. The next step would typically be to update `activeContext.md`, `globalContext.md`, and create/update `mode-specific/holistic-reviewer.md` before calling `attempt_completion`.
