# Holistic Reviewer Feedback Log
<!-- Entries below should be added reverse chronologically (newest first) -->
### CLI Acquire Review - [2025-05-03 14:07:37]
- **Source:** Task request for holistic review of CLI `acquire` functionality post-stabilization.
- **Issue/Findings:**
    1.  **Critical Test Gap:** `test_acquire_confirmation_flow_yes_flag` remains skipped due to intractable mocking issue, leaving `--yes` auto-confirm success path untested. [Ref: Task HR-CLI-ACQ-01]
    2.  **Test Redundancy:** Duplicate/overlapping tests exist for `acquire` API error handling scenarios in `tests/cli/test_cli_main.py`.
- **Action/Recommendations:**
    1.  Prioritize resolving the mocking blocker for the skipped `--yes` test (delegate to `debug`/`tdd`).
    2.  Consolidate redundant error handling tests in `tests/cli/test_cli_main.py` (delegate to `tdd`).
- **Status:** Review complete. Report generated (`docs/reviews/cli_acquire_review_20250503.md`). Memory Bank updated. No new immediate delegations created, but recommendations reinforce existing needs.
### CLI Acquire Review - [2025-05-02 13:01:39]
- **Source:** Task request for holistic review of CLI `acquire` functionality.
- **Issue/Findings:**
    1.  **Refactoring Needed (`src/philograph/cli/main.py`):** The `acquire` command function is overly complex (~140 lines) and contains duplicated logic for displaying the confirmation table.
    2.  **Critical Test Gap (`tests/cli/test_cli_main.py`):** Key tests for the `--yes` auto-confirmation logic are skipped due to a persistent mocking/`CliRunner` `TypeError` [Ref: Debug Feedback 2025-05-02 05:28:06].
    3.  **Test Hygiene (`tests/cli/test_cli_main.py`):** Obsolete skipped tests for `acquire-missing-texts` remain. Some redundancy in `status` tests.
    4.  **Documentation Gap (`src/philograph/cli/main.py`):** The complex confirmation flow in `acquire` lacks sufficient inline comments.
    5.  **Code Hygiene (`src/philograph/cli/main.py`):** Minor leftover comments in table creation logic.
- **Action/Recommendations:**
    1.  Delegate investigation of the test mocking blocker to `debug` mode (Critical Priority).
    2.  Delegate refactoring of the `acquire` command (extract confirmation flow, table display) and cleanup of minor hygiene issues to `code` or `optimizer` mode (High Priority).
    3.  Delegate adding inline comments to the `acquire` confirmation flow to `docs-writer` or `code` mode (Medium Priority).
    4.  Delegate removal of obsolete tests and consolidation of redundant tests to `tdd` mode *after* blocker resolution and refactoring (Low Priority).
- **Status:** Review complete. Findings documented. Delegations pending.

### Early Return: Context Limit Exceeded - [2025-04-29 17:57:30]
- **Trigger:** Context size reached 52% after reading implementation files and generating the status report.
- **Task:** Project State Analysis & Deviation Report.
- **Progress:**
    - Memory Bank initialized.
    - Reviewed planning documents (Specs v2.3, Arch, ADRs 001/004/008, Pseudocode).
    - Reviewed core implementation files (`src/philograph/api/main.py`, `cli/main.py`, `data_access/db_layer.py`, `ingestion/pipeline.py`, `search/service.py`, `acquisition/service.py`, `mcp/main.py`).
    - Generated the requested report: `docs/reports/project_status_review_2025-04-29.md`.
- **Blocker:** Context size limit (52%) prevents proceeding with Memory Bank updates before final completion.
- **Analysis:** Task involved reading numerous large documents and code files, leading to rapid context accumulation.
- **Self-Correction:** Adhering to Early Return protocol.
- **Context %:** 52%
- **Recommendations:** Handover to SPARC or user. The generated report is available, but Memory Bank updates were not performed. The next step would typically be to update `activeContext.md`, `globalContext.md`, and create/update `mode-specific/holistic-reviewer.md` before calling `attempt_completion`.
