### [2025-05-04 03:37:52] - Refactor Acquisition Workflow (Task 2025-05-04 03:31:41)
- **Source:** User Task
- **Issue:** Refactor acquisition workflow implementation (`acquisition/service.py`, `api/main.py`, `mcp/main.py`) post-TDD Green phase for clarity, modularity, and consistency.
- **Action:**
    - `service.py`: Extracted helper functions (`_check_rate_limit`, `_validate_selected_items`, `_process_single_item`), added `TypedDict` for session structure, removed TDD comments.
    - `api/main.py`: Standardized `acquisition_service` import, standardized `UUID` type hints, updated collection models/endpoints to use `UUID`, removed duplicate exception raise, removed TDD comments.
    - `mcp/main.py`: Removed TDD comments, cleaned up `if __name__ == "__main__"` block.
- **Outcome:** Refactoring completed successfully. Test verification (`pytest` within Docker container) passed (exit code 0). Memory Bank updated.
