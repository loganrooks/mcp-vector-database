### [2025-05-05 02:11:50] - Optimizer - Early Return Invoked

-   **Trigger:** High context usage (71%) and persistent, numerous test failures (91 failed, 68 errors) after multiple correction attempts.
-   **Blocker:**
    -   API Tests (`tests/api/*`): 68 errors related to `AttributeError: 'async_generator' object has no attribute 'post'/'get'/'delete'`, indicating issues with the `test_client` fixture consumption.
    -   Data Access Tests (`tests/data_access/*`): 23 failures due to SQL string/parameter mismatches, missing config attributes (`DB_POOL_MIN_SIZE`, `PGVECTOR_HNSW_M`), and incorrect mock patch targets (`json_serialize`).
-   **Progress:**
    -   Refactored `tests/utils/test_text_processing.py` into `test_text_extraction.py`, `test_text_grobid.py`, `test_text_chunking.py`, `test_text_references.py`.
    -   Refactored `tests/ingestion/test_pipeline.py` into `test_pipeline_single_file.py` and `test_pipeline_directory.py`.
    -   Attempted fixes for `test_client` fixture, SQL assertions, config variables, and mock patches across several test and source files.
-   **Analysis:** The remaining errors, particularly the API fixture issue and the widespread data access assertion failures, require more focused debugging or refactoring that is difficult to manage with the current context limitations. The config attribute errors suggest potential issues with environment setup within the Docker container during testing.
-   **Self-Correction:** Multiple attempts were made to fix SQL assertions and mock patches based on error messages, but subtle inconsistencies or underlying issues persist.
-   **Context %:** ~71%
-   **Recommendations:**
    1.  Delegate API test fixture debugging to `debugger` mode (`new_task`).
    2.  Delegate data access test debugging (SQL assertions, config errors, mock patches) to `tdd` or `debugger` mode (`new_task`). Focus on ensuring exact SQL string matching, correct parameter handling (tuples vs lists), proper config loading in the test environment, and correct mock patch targets.

### [2025-05-04 03:37:52] - Refactor Acquisition Workflow (Task 2025-05-04 03:31:41)
- **Source:** User Task
- **Issue:** Refactor acquisition workflow implementation (`acquisition/service.py`, `api/main.py`, `mcp/main.py`) post-TDD Green phase for clarity, modularity, and consistency.
- **Action:**
    - `service.py`: Extracted helper functions (`_check_rate_limit`, `_validate_selected_items`, `_process_single_item`), added `TypedDict` for session structure, removed TDD comments.
    - `api/main.py`: Standardized `acquisition_service` import, standardized `UUID` type hints, updated collection models/endpoints to use `UUID`, removed duplicate exception raise, removed TDD comments.
    - `mcp/main.py`: Removed TDD comments, cleaned up `if __name__ == "__main__"` block.
- **Outcome:** Refactoring completed successfully. Test verification (`pytest` within Docker container) passed (exit code 0). Memory Bank updated.
