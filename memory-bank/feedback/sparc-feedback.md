### [2025-04-30 15:17:23] Intervention: Incorrect Context Calculation & Handover
- **Trigger**: User Correction
- **Context**: SPARC incorrectly calculated context percentage as 88% (actual ~12.1%) and initiated unnecessary handover via DELEGATE CLAUSE.
- **Action Taken**: Acknowledged error, reverted handover log entry in `activeContext.md`.
- **Rationale**: Misinterpretation of context reporting or calculation error by SPARC.
- **Outcome**: Handover aborted, proceeding with original task delegation.
- **Follow-up**: Monitor context calculation more carefully.
### [2025-04-28 17:14:13] Intervention: Incorrect Context Percentage Calculation
- **Trigger**: User Feedback denying handover `new_task`.
- **Context**: SPARC initiated handover due to reported context size exceeding threshold (e.g., 181%).
- **Action Taken**: User clarified that the percentage in `environment_details` is incorrect. Correct calculation is `(Reported Tokens / 1,000,000) * 100`. SPARC recalculated (e.g., 21%) and aborted handover.
- **Rationale**: Avoid unnecessary handover based on faulty system reporting. Follow user guidance for accurate context monitoring.
- **Outcome**: Handover aborted. Workflow continues.
- **Follow-up**: SPARC and delegated modes must manually calculate context percentage until the reporting bug is fixed. Include this instruction in future delegations. Logged as system issue.
# SPARC Mode Feedback Log
### [2025-04-29 15:32:05] User Intervention: Manual Completion of Git Commit Task
- **Trigger**: User message indicating manual completion of the "Manage Git Debt" task.
- **Context**: The task was delegated to `devops` mode [Ref: SPARC Delegation 2025-04-29 14:26:53]. User stepped in to perform the analysis and commits. Provided commit hashes and details. Confirmed working directory is clean.
- **Action Taken**: Acknowledged user's completion. Preparing to address the next blocker.
- **Rationale**: Incorporating user-provided Git status to proceed with planning next steps.
- **Outcome**: Git debt managed. Working directory clean. `main` branch is 6 commits ahead of `origin/main`.
- **Follow-up**: Address the primary blocker: GCP credentials.
### [2025-04-29 14:26:26] User Intervention: Manual Completion of State Analysis
- **Trigger**: User message indicating manual completion of the "Project State Analysis" task.
- **Context**: The delegated `holistic-reviewer` task failed due to context limits [Ref: SPARC Feedback 2025-04-29 13:58:04]. User stepped in to perform the analysis and created `docs/reports/project_status_review_2025-04-29.md`. User also updated relevant Memory Bank files.
- **Action Taken**: Acknowledged user's completion. Preparing to read the generated report.
- **Rationale**: Incorporating user-provided analysis to proceed with planning next steps (Git Debt, GCP Blocker).
- **Outcome**: State analysis completed manually by user. Report available.
- **Follow-up**: Read the report `docs/reports/project_status_review_2025-04-29.md`. Plan next steps based on report findings (Git Debt, GCP Blocker).
### [2025-04-29 13:58:04] Holistic Reviewer Immediate Early Return &amp; SPARC Handover
- **Trigger**: Received immediate Early Return from `holistic-reviewer` for task "Project State Analysis & Deviation Report" due to context limit (Reported 53%, Manually Calc ~92%).
- **Context**: Task was delegated following user request to pause debugging and perform state analysis/git debt management [Ref: SPARC Feedback 2025-04-29 13:49:57]. The immediate failure indicates the analysis task is too large for one instance or context issues are severe.
- **Action Taken**: Acknowledged Early Return. Logging event. Initiating manual handover to a new SPARC instance via `new_task`.
- **Rationale**: The immediate failure of the delegated task suggests a need for a fresh start and potentially breaking down the state analysis and git debt tasks further. Handover provides the cleanest way to manage this.
- **Outcome**: Pending handover to new SPARC instance.
- **Follow-up**: Create `new_task` for `sparc` with handover instructions, emphasizing context challenges and the need for smaller task delegations.
### [2025-04-29 13:49:57] User Intervention &amp; Plan Adjustment (Context Correction)
- **Trigger**: User request to pause debugging, perform project state analysis, and manage git debt. User correction on context size calculation.
- **Context**: Current workflow blocked pending valid GCP credentials for `litellm-proxy` [Ref: Debug Early Return 2025-04-29 13:41:15]. User requested a higher-level review and git management. Previous assessment of context limit (based on potentially buggy report) was incorrect; manually calculated context is ~14%.
- **Action Taken**: Acknowledged user request and context calculation correction. Aborted unnecessary handover. Proceeding with user's request: State Analysis and Git Debt Management first, while acknowledging the GCP credential blocker remains.
- **Rationale**: Prioritizing user direction. Correcting course based on accurate context assessment.
- **Outcome**: Plan adjusted. Preparing State Analysis delegation.
- **Follow-up**: Delegate State Analysis task to `holistic-reviewer` or `architect`. Delegate Git Debt task to `devops` or `code`. Address GCP blocker afterwards.
### [2025-04-29 13:45:37] User Intervention &amp; SPARC Handover (Context Limit 60%)
- **Trigger**: User request to pause debugging, perform project state analysis, and manage git debt. Context limit (60%) exceeded.
- **Context**: Current workflow blocked pending valid GCP credentials for `litellm-proxy` [Ref: Debug Early Return 2025-04-29 13:41:15]. User requested a higher-level review and git management.
- **Action Taken**: Acknowledged user request. Logging intervention. Initiating self-handover via `new_task` due to exceeding context limit (DELEGATE CLAUSE).
- **Rationale**: Adhering to context management protocol. Handing over to a fresh instance to handle the state analysis and git debt tasks while preserving context.
- **Outcome**: Pending handover to new SPARC instance.
- **Follow-up**: Create `new_task` for `sparc` with handover instructions.
### [2025-04-29 13:41:15] Debug Early Return (Context/Blocker) &amp; User Action Required
- **Trigger**: Received Early Return from `debug` mode for task "Investigate Widespread Test Failures".
- **Context**: `debug` mode fixed most test failures but identified the remaining `/search` failures are due to invalid GCP credentials (`dummy-gcp-key.json`) preventing `litellm-proxy` from authenticating with Vertex AI. Context limit (57%) also reached. [Ref: Debug Early Return 2025-04-29 13:41:15]
- **Action Taken**: Acknowledged Early Return and blocker. Preparing to ask the user to provide valid GCP credentials.
- **Rationale**: Cannot proceed with test verification without valid credentials for `litellm-proxy`.
- **Outcome**: Blocked pending user action on credentials.
- **Follow-up**: Use `ask_followup_question` to request credential setup confirmation. Then, initiate handover due to context limit. (Note: Cannot update delegation status in `sparc.md` due to file restrictions; this entry serves as the record).
### [2025-04-29 11:31:50] TDD Early Return &amp; Debug Delegation
- **Trigger**: Received Early Return from `tdd` mode for task "Regression Testing &amp; Adapt `/ingest` Test Case".
- **Context**: `tdd` mode ran the full test suite (`pytest`) after the `/ingest` 404 fix. Encountered 25 failures and 1 error across multiple modules, indicating regressions or revealed issues. [Ref: TDD Feedback 2025-04-29 11:30:13]
- **Action Taken**: Acknowledged Early Return. Preparing to delegate to `debug` mode to investigate the root causes of the widespread test failures, focusing on ingestion path resolution, API 404s, and config test issues as recommended by TDD.
- **Rationale**: Address the regressions/new issues before proceeding with test adaptation.
- **Outcome**: Pending Debug delegation.
- **Follow-up**: Create `new_task` for `debug`. (Note: Cannot update delegation status in `sparc.md` due to file restrictions; this entry serves as the record).
### [2025-04-29 11:27:31] Debug Task Completed &amp; TDD Delegation
- **Trigger**: Received successful `attempt_completion` from `debug` mode for task "Re-debug `/ingest` API Endpoint 404 Handling".
- **Context**: `debug` mode fixed variable shadowing and exception handling in `src/philograph/api/main.py`, resolving the 500 error. Verification confirmed `/ingest` now returns 404 for missing files. [Ref: Debug Completion 2025-04-29 11:27:31]
- **Action Taken**: Acknowledged completion. Preparing to delegate to `tdd` mode to run the full test suite, check for regressions, and adapt `tests/cli/test_main.py::test_ingest_success` for the 404 response.
- **Rationale**: Follows `debug` mode recommendation to ensure overall test suite health after the fix.
- **Outcome**: Pending TDD delegation.
- **Follow-up**: Create `new_task` for `tdd`. (Note: Cannot update delegation status in `sparc.md` due to file restrictions; this entry serves as the record).
### [2025-04-29 04:00:50] Handover Triggered: SPARC Context Limit Exceeded (DELEGATE CLAUSE - 53%)
- **Trigger**: SPARC context size reached 53% (105,927 tokens) after receiving Early Return from `tdd` mode.
- **Context**: `tdd` mode was testing `src/philograph/cli/main.py`. It fixed environment issues and completed tests for `show document` (success) and `show chunk` (success). It returned early due to its own context limit (50%) [Ref: TDD Feedback 2025-04-29 04:00:16].
- **Action Taken**: Invoking `DELEGATE CLAUSE`. Preparing handover message for a new SPARC instance via `new_task`.
- **Rationale**: Adhering to `context_management` protocol to prevent performance degradation or errors due to excessive context size.
- **Outcome**: Handing over control to a new SPARC instance.
- **Follow-up**: New SPARC instance to initialize Memory Bank (including latest TDD feedback), and delegate the next TDD task for CLI testing (starting with remaining `show` command cases: invalid type, not found, API error). [Ref: Previous SPARC Handover: 2025-04-29 03:44:06]
### [2025-04-29 03:44:06] Handover Triggered: SPARC Context Limit Exceeded (DELEGATE CLAUSE - 83%)
- **Trigger**: SPARC context size reached 83% (165,314 tokens) after receiving Early Return from `tdd` mode.
- **Context**: `tdd` mode was testing `src/philograph/cli/main.py`. It verified the `make_api_request` `ConnectionError` fix, completed tests for other `make_api_request` errors (`HTTPStatusError`, `JSONDecodeError`, `Exception`), and basic `ingest` command tests (`success`, `api_error`). It returned early due to its own context limit (~46%) [Ref: TDD Feedback 2025-04-29 03:42:52].
- **Action Taken**: Invoking `DELEGATE CLAUSE`. Preparing handover message for a new SPARC instance via `new_task`.
- **Rationale**: Adhering to `context_management` protocol to prevent performance degradation or errors due to excessive context size.
- **Outcome**: Handing over control to a new SPARC instance.
- **Follow-up**: New SPARC instance to initialize Memory Bank (including latest TDD feedback), and delegate the next TDD task for CLI testing (starting with the `search` command). [Ref: Previous SPARC Handover: 2025-04-29 03:35:12]
### [2025-04-29 03:35:12] Handover Triggered: SPARC Context Limit Exceeded (DELEGATE CLAUSE)
- **Trigger**: SPARC context size reached 92% after receiving Early Return from `tdd` mode.
- **Context**: `tdd` mode was testing `src/philograph/cli/main.py` and returned early due to its own context limit (50%) after adding tests for the `make_api_request` helper function. The last test added (`test_make_api_request_connection_error`) requires verification.
- **Action Taken**: Invoking `DELEGATE CLAUSE`. Preparing handover message for a new SPARC instance via `new_task`.
- **Rationale**: Adhering to `context_management` protocol to prevent performance degradation or errors due to excessive context size.
- **Outcome**: Handing over control to a new SPARC instance.
- **Follow-up**: New SPARC instance to initialize Memory Bank, review `tdd` feedback, and delegate the next TDD task for CLI testing.
### [2025-04-29 03:28:01] TDD Task Completed: API `/acquire/status/{id}` Tests
- **Trigger**: Received successful `attempt_completion` from `tdd` mode.
- **Context**: `tdd` mode was tasked with resuming tests for `GET /acquire/status/{id}` after a previous Early Return [Ref: TDD Feedback 2025-04-29 03:17:58].
- **Action Taken**: Acknowledged completion. `tdd` mode verified the previous fix and added/passed tests for completed, failed, not found, and invalid ID format cases. Minor fixes applied to API model (`AcquisitionStatusResponse`) and test code. All API tests for `/acquire` endpoints appear complete.
- **Rationale**: Task successfully executed by `tdd` mode.
- **Outcome**: API testing for `/acquire` endpoints concluded. Ready for next testing phase.
- **Follow-up**: Delegating next TDD task: testing `src/philograph/cli/main.py`.
### [2025-04-29 02:59:08] Handover: SPARC Context Limit Exceeded (116%)
- **Trigger**: DELEGATE CLAUSE (Context reported at 116% in `environment_details`).
- **Context**: Received Early Return from `tdd` mode [Ref: 2025-04-29 02:57:49] after it completed tests for `POST /collections/{id}/items` (duplicate) and `GET /collections/{id}` (success, empty, 404). TDD context was 51%.
- **Action Taken**: Updated `activeContext.md` and `globalContext.md`. Preparing to initiate handover via `new_task`.
- **Rationale**: Maintain operational stability by handing over to a fresh instance due to critical context size.
- **Outcome**: Pending handover completion.
- **Follow-up**: New SPARC instance to resume workflow by delegating the next TDD task (testing `/acquire` endpoints).
<!-- Entries below should be added reverse chronologically (newest first) -->

### [2025-04-28 10:02:37] Delegation: Git Initialization and Commit Task

*   **Trigger**: Early Return from `tdd` mode due to user request to address version control.
*   **Context**: `tdd` mode completed initial tests for 4 utility modules after `code` mode finished initial implementation. Need to establish git history before proceeding.
*   **Action Taken**: Delegating task to `devops` mode to initialize git, review changes, and create logical commits.
*   **Rationale**: Address user requirement for version control before accumulating more changes ("git debt"). `devops` mode is suitable for establishing repository practices.
*   **Outcome**: Pending `devops` mode completion.
*   **Follow-up**: Resume `tdd` testing task after git history is established.
*   **Note**: Due to SPARC file restrictions, this log entry serves as the record instead of `sparc.md#Delegations Log`. Core MB files (`activeContext.md`, `globalContext.md`) cannot be updated by SPARC.
### [2025-04-28 03:53:15] Intervention: Premature Handover due to Context Misjudgment

*   **Trigger**: User Correction.
*   **Context**: SPARC incorrectly assessed the context window size (reported 81% when it was lower, e.g., 13% then 68%) and prematurely initiated the DELEGATE CLAUSE handover procedure.
*   **Action Taken**: Logged the error. Cancelled the handover `new_task` call.
*   **Rationale**: Misinterpretation or misreading of the context window size metric provided in the environment details.
*   **Outcome**: Unnecessary handover attempt aborted. Workflow continues under the current instance for now.
*   **Follow-up**: SPARC must pay closer attention to the actual context window percentage provided in `environment_details` and apply the 40-50% threshold accurately before triggering the DELEGATE CLAUSE.
### [2025-04-28 03:50:05] Intervention: Memory Bank Update Failed (File Restriction)

*   **Trigger**: `FileRestrictionError` during `insert_content` tool use.
*   **Context**: Attempting to update `memory-bank/activeContext.md` with the status that Tier 0 pseudocode generation was complete.
*   **Action Taken**: Logged the error. Halted direct update attempt.
*   **Rationale**: The SPARC mode has restricted write access, only permitted for files matching `.*sparc.*\.md$ (Feedback files only)`. Core Memory Bank files like `activeContext.md` are protected from direct modification by this mode.
*   **Outcome**: `activeContext.md` was not updated with the latest status.
*   **Follow-up**: Need to investigate alternative mechanisms for updating core Memory Bank files (`activeContext.md`, `globalContext.md`). Potential options include delegating updates to `memory-bank-doctor` mode or requesting user intervention/guidance. This restriction must be considered in future Memory Bank update planning.
### [2025-04-28 03:38:36] User Feedback: Version Control Guidance in Delegations

*   **Source:** User interaction following Architect mode completion summary.
*   **Issue:** SPARC delegation messages lack instructions regarding version control practices.
*   **Action:** SPARC must include guidance in `new_task` messages specifying:
    *   When commits are appropriate (e.g., before successful `attempt_completion`).
    *   That commits are *not* needed before an `attempt_completion` triggered by an Early Return.
    *   That workspace clearing is not needed when resuming after an Early Return, especially if only memory bank files changed.
*   **Learnings:** Providing clear version control expectations within task delegations improves workflow consistency and reduces ambiguity for delegated modes.
### [2025-04-27 23:36:16] User Feedback: Delegation Process Refinement

*   **Source:** User interaction during SPARC task delegation.
*   **Issue:** SPARC's `new_task` messages lack explicit initialization instructions for the receiving mode.
*   **Action:** SPARC must include clear instructions in `new_task` messages specifying what context the receiving mode needs to establish (e.g., "Read file X", "Review Decision Log in globalContext.md").
*   **Learnings:** Providing explicit context-setting steps improves clarity and reduces potential errors for delegated modes.

### [2025-04-27 23:35:14] User Feedback: Delegation Process Refinement

*   **Source:** User interaction during SPARC task delegation.
*   **Issue:**
    1.  SPARC did not read the relevant specification file (`docs/project-specifications.md`) before formulating instructions for the `architect` mode based on that spec.
    2.  SPARC did not explicitly instruct the `architect` mode (and other modes) to provide detailed completion messages summarizing work, challenges, learnings, etc.
*   **Action:**
    1.  SPARC must read necessary source documents before creating delegation instructions based on them.
    2.  SPARC must include explicit instructions in `new_task` messages requiring detailed completion summaries from the receiving mode.
*   **Learnings:** Reading source files ensures delegation instructions are accurate. Requiring detailed completion messages improves transparency and context transfer upon task completion.

### [2025-04-27 23:32:36] User Feedback: Memory Bank Reading Optimization

*   **Source:** User interaction during SPARC Memory Bank synchronization.
*   **Issue:** SPARC reads entire `activeContext.md` and `globalContext.md` files even when only recent or specific information is needed.
*   **Action:** SPARC should use partial reads (`read_file` with `start_line`/`end_line`) for `activeContext.md` (focusing on recent entries) and attempt targeted reads or analysis for `globalContext.md` where possible.
*   **Learnings:** Optimizing Memory Bank reads reduces token usage and improves efficiency.
