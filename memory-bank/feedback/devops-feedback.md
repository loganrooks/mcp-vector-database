### Early Return - Intractable Docker Build Issue - [2025-04-29 02:19:23]
- **Trigger**: Persistent failure (5+ attempts) to verify `/app/tests` directory existence in `philograph-backend` container, despite successful builds and explicit `COPY tests /app/tests` in `Dockerfile`. Context size 32%.
- **Context**: Task was to verify Docker environment fix for TDD mode. The `tests` directory needs to be accessible within the container.
- **Issue**: `docker compose exec [-u root] philograph-backend ls -l /app/tests` consistently fails with "No such file or directory", even after successful builds with `--no-cache`.
- **Attempts**:
    1. Verified `COPY ./tests /app/tests` in `Dockerfile`.
    2. Added `chown` before `USER` change.
    3. Verified no `.dockerignore`.
    4. Listed `/app` (showed `tests` missing post-build).
    5. Modified `COPY` paths.
    6. Added `RUN ls -l /app` debug step (output not captured).
    7. Explicitly added `COPY tests /app/tests` and removed `COPY . /app`.
    8. Ran verification `exec` command as root (`-u root`).
- **Analysis**: Despite the build log showing the `COPY tests /app/tests` step completing, the directory is not present in the final image layer accessible via `exec`. Standard troubleshooting (permissions, build context, explicit copy, removing potentially conflicting `COPY .`) has failed. Root cause is likely a deeper Docker issue (layering, cache, daemon state) or an unobserved error during the build's `COPY` step.
- **Self-Correction**: Exhausted standard DevOps troubleshooting steps for Docker COPY issues. Invoking Early Return due to intractable blocker.
- **Context %**: 32%
- **Recommendation**: Invoke Early Return. This Docker build issue is preventing test execution. Recommend escalating to manual investigation or a dedicated debugging session focusing on Docker layer inspection (`docker history`, `docker inspect`, potentially using tools like `dive`) to understand why the `COPY tests /app/tests` layer isn't persisting or accessible. Alternatively, consider mounting the `tests` directory as a volume in `docker-compose.yml` specifically for the testing stage/service as a workaround, though this deviates from building a self-contained testable image.

### User Intervention Log: [2025-04-28 10:20:42]
- **Trigger**: User message correcting initial assumption about repository existence.
- **Context**: DevOps mode assumed repository needed initialization (`git init`).
- **Action**: User clarified repository exists, but changes are uncommitted.
- **Rationale**: Initial task description was slightly ambiguous ("lacks version control").
- **Outcome**: Task objective adjusted to staging/committing existing changes instead of initializing. Proceeded with `git status` and logical commits.
- **Follow-up**: Ensure future Git tasks start with `git status` to verify assumptions.
