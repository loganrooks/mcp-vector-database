### User Intervention Log: [2025-04-28 10:20:42]
- **Trigger**: User message correcting initial assumption about repository existence.
- **Context**: DevOps mode assumed repository needed initialization (`git init`).
- **Action**: User clarified repository exists, but changes are uncommitted.
- **Rationale**: Initial task description was slightly ambiguous ("lacks version control").
- **Outcome**: Task objective adjusted to staging/committing existing changes instead of initializing. Proceeded with `git status` and logical commits.
- **Follow-up**: Ensure future Git tasks start with `git status` to verify assumptions.
