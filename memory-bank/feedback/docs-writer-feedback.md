- **Source**: User Task (Holistic Review Documentation Updates)
- **Document**: README.md, docs/architecture/adr/00*.md, .env.example, docs/project-specifications.md
- **Feedback**: Holistic Review identified outdated documentation regarding CLI commands, MCP tools, DB initialization, ADR statuses, .env context, and embedding dimension consistency.
- **Analysis**: Required reading source code (CLI, MCP), ADRs, and project specs to verify current implementation and update documentation accordingly. Mode switching was necessary to edit `.env.example`. Error handling was needed for `apply_diff` due to content mismatch.
- **Action**: Updated README.md (acquire command, MCP tools, DB init), updated ADR 001-009 statuses to "Implemented", added comments to .env.example (via code mode), corrected embedding dimension example in project-specifications.md to 768.

### Feedback: [2025-05-02 16:19:21]
- **Source**: Task: Update CLI Documentation for `acquire` Command
- **Document**: `README.md`
- **Feedback**: Updated the CLI Usage section for the `acquire` command to reflect current functionality after recent refactoring. Included details on options (`--title`, `--author`, `--find-missing-threshold`, `--yes`), workflow (search, confirmation table, selection/cancellation, auto-confirm), and provided updated examples.
- **Analysis**: The previous documentation was minimal and outdated. The new section accurately describes the command based on `src/philograph/cli/main.py` and recent feedback logs.
- **Action**: Applied changes to `README.md` using `apply_diff`.
