### [2025-04-29 04:18:51] Intervention: Fix Syntax Errors after TDD Early Return
- **Trigger**: Task handover from TDD mode due to Early Return and persistent syntax errors [Ref: TDD Feedback 2025-04-29 04:17:00].
- **Context**: Syntax errors (stray parenthesis, duplicate line) around line 597 in `tests/cli/test_main.py` introduced by failed tool use (`insert_content`/`apply_diff`) during TDD.
- **Action Taken**: Used `apply_diff` to remove the erroneous lines 597 and 598.
- **Rationale**: Direct removal of identified incorrect lines.
- **Outcome**: Syntax errors corrected. File requires verification.
- **Follow-up**: Recommend `pytest --collect-only` verification. Update Memory Bank.
