# Code Mode Feedback Log
<!-- Entries below should be added reverse chronologically (newest first) -->
### [2025-05-10 16:40:15] Tool Usage Note: `apply_diff` Failures
- **Trigger**: Attempting to modify `synthetic_test_data/common.py` and `tests/synthetic_test_data/test_epub_generators.py`.
- **Context**: Task to refactor synthetic data output paths.
- **Action Taken**: `apply_diff` tool failed multiple times with "Diff block is malformed: marker '=======' found in your diff content..." error, even when the diff content itself did not contain the marker within the search/replace blocks. Switched to using `write_to_file` with the full modified content as a workaround.
- **Rationale**: `apply_diff` was unreliable for these specific changes.
- **Outcome**: Modifications successfully applied using `write_to_file`.
- **Follow-up**: Potential issue with `apply_diff` parsing or CDATA handling for multi-line diffs needs investigation if this recurs.
### [2025-05-10 04:17:00] Task: Fix EPUB HTML Entities &amp; Refactor EPUB Generation Script - Debugging Follow-up
- **Trigger**: User Feedback on persistent EPUB issues.
- **Context**: After refactoring, `adobe_artifacts.epub`, `navdoc_full.epub`, and `pippin_style_endnotes.epub` remained problematic.
- **Action Taken**:
    - **`adobe_artifacts.epub`**:
        - Identified that the "Duplicate name: 'EPUB/META-INF/template.xpgt'" warning was likely due to `custom_files_to_add` in `common.py` and `manifest_extra_items` in `create_epub_structure_adobe_artifacts` both trying to manage the `template.xpgt` file.
        - Removed `manifest_extra_items` entry for `template.xpgt` in `create_epub_structure_adobe_artifacts`, relying on `custom_files_to_add`. This resolved the duplicate name warning.
        - Changed spine in `create_epub_structure_adobe_artifacts` from `['nav'] + chapters` to `chapters` as 'nav' for NCX is not a spine item in EPUB2. User confirmed this fixed the TypeError for `adobe_artifacts.epub`.
    - **`navdoc_full.epub`**:
        - Hypothesized the "indexOf" TypeError might be related to landmarks or page-list in NavDoc. Commented these sections out. User reported a *new* TypeError ("reading 'next'").
        - Restored the landmarks, page-list, and the fallback NCX. User reported the error reverted to the original "indexOf" TypeError. The issue remains unresolved.
    - **`pippin_style_endnotes.epub`**:
        - Hypothesized content might be the issue for blank rendering. Simplified chapter and endnote content significantly. User reported it's still blank. The issue remains unresolved.
- **Rationale**: Attempting to isolate and fix reported EPUB rendering issues.
- **Outcome**:
    - `adobe_artifacts.epub` TypeError is now resolved.
    - `navdoc_full.epub` continues to show a TypeError ("indexOf").
    - `pippin_style_endnotes.epub` continues to be blank.
- **Follow-up**: These two EPUBs (`navdoc_full`, `pippin_style_endnotes`) have persistent issues that may require deeper EPUB structural analysis or different generation approaches beyond simple trial-and-error.
### [2025-05-10 03:01:30] Task: Correct HTML Entities &amp; Continue Synthetic Data Expansion
- **Trigger**: User Task (Correct HTML entity encoding, fix `create_epub2_with_guide`, review ToCs, expand data).
- **Context**: Previous work on `feat/synthetic-test-data` branch encountered HTML entity issues and errors in EPUB generation.
- **Action Taken**:
    - Verified current branch is `feat/synthetic-test-data`.
    - Corrected HTML entity encoding in `synthetic_test_data/generate_epubs.py` by replacing `&amp;lt;` with `&lt;` and `&amp;gt;` with `&gt;` using `search_and_replace`. Other entities (`&amp;amp;`, `&amp;quot;`, `&amp;apos;`) did not require changes.
    - Ran `python3 -m synthetic_test_data.generate_all_data` to test EPUB generation.
    - Addressed "argument of type 'NoneType' is not iterable" error in `create_epub2_with_guide` by:
        - Uncommenting the call in `generate_all_data.py`.
        - Ensuring `book.epub_version = "2.0"` was set.
        - Setting `book.guide = []` initially, then restoring a more complete guide definition.
        - Correcting the spine to `[cover_page, toc_page] + chapters`.
        - Commenting out `book.add_metadata('OPF', 'cover', 'cover-image')` as no actual cover image item was defined, which resolved the error.
    - Reviewed ToC simplifications:
        - Expanded `book.toc` for `create_epub_ncx_links_to_anchors` to be more representative.
        - Expanded `book.toc` for `create_epub_html_toc_p_tags` to be more representative. This initially caused an `IndexError` due to a misapplied diff from a previous session, which was then corrected.
    - Added new EPUB generation functions:
        - `create_epub_html_toc_non_linked` for non-hyperlinked HTML ToCs.
        - `create_epub_header_foucault_style` for Foucault-style headers.
    - Added calls to new functions in `generate_all_data.py` and corrected indentation issues caused by `insert_content`.
    - Updated `synthetic_test_data/README.md` with new files and changes.
- **Rationale**: Addressing critical blockers and continuing feature development as per task requirements.
- **Outcome**:
    - HTML entity encoding in EPUB content strings corrected.
    - `create_epub2_with_guide` now generates without the `NoneType` error and appears mostly functional.
    - ToCs for `ncx_links_to_anchors` and `html_toc_p_tags` are improved.
    - Two new EPUB variations added.
    - README updated.
    - Persistent rendering issues remain for `pippin_style_endnotes.epub` (empty content), `navdoc_full.epub` (JS error), and `adobe_artifacts.epub` (JS error). Further debugging of these was deferred due to complexity and time constraints.
- **Follow-up**: Commit changes. Recommend TDD run. Suggest deferring further work on the three problematic EPUBs unless they block critical testing.
### [2025-05-09 21:55:00] Task: Expand Synthetic Test Data Generation (EPUB, PDF, Markdown)
- **Trigger**: User Task.
- **Context**: Expand synthetic data scripts in `synthetic_test_data/` to cover detailed EPUB, PDF, and Markdown scenarios from `docs/qa/synthetic_data_requirements.md`. Continue on `feat/synthetic-test-data` branch.
- **Action Taken**:
    - Reviewed `docs/qa/synthetic_data_requirements.md` extensively.
    - Added numerous new EPUB generation functions to `synthetic_test_data/generate_epubs.py` covering variations in ToC, Headers, Footnotes/Endnotes (various reference styles and locations), Citations/Bibliographies, Page Numbers/Edition Markers, Images/Fonts (simulated obfuscation, image as text), Structure/Metadata (EPUB2 guide, OPF meta, page-map ref, split files, Calibre/Adobe artifacts, accessibility types), and Content Types (dialogue, epigraphs, blockquotes, internal cross-refs, forced page breaks).
    - Debugged several issues in EPUB generation, primarily related to `ebooklib`'s handling of ToC structures and guide elements. Simplified ToCs for `ncx_links_to_anchors` and `html_toc_p_tags` to resolve "'Link' object is not iterable" errors. Commented out `create_epub2_with_guide` due to a persistent "argument of type 'NoneType' is not iterable" error.
    - Modified `synthetic_test_data/common.py` (`_write_epub_file`) to provide basic support for adding custom files (e.g., `encryption.xml`) and manifest items, noting limitations with `ebooklib` for precise placement outside `OEBPS`.
    - Added new PDF generation functions to `synthetic_test_data/generate_pdfs.py` for multi-column text, text flow around images (simulated), simulated high-quality OCR, bookmark-based ToCs, visual hyperlinked ToCs, running headers/footers, bottom-page footnotes, and simple tables. Debugged `NameError` for `SimpleDocTemplate` and a `ValueError` for outline levels in bookmark generation.
    - Added new Markdown generation functions to `synthetic_test_data/generate_markdown.py` for JSON frontmatter, erroneous frontmatter, no frontmatter, embedded HTML, and LaTeX expressions.
    - Updated `synthetic_test_data/generate_all_data.py` to call all new generation functions (except the problematic `create_epub2_with_guide`).
    - Successfully executed `python3 -m synthetic_test_data.generate_all_data` to generate the new suite of files.
    - Updated `synthetic_test_data/README.md` with a comprehensive list of all generated files and their categories.
- **Rationale**: Fulfilling task requirements to significantly expand synthetic test data coverage.
- **Outcome**: Synthetic data generation scripts for EPUB, PDF, and Markdown substantially enhanced. A large number of new synthetic files generated. README updated. One EPUB function (`create_epub2_with_guide`) remains problematic and is temporarily disabled.
- **Follow-up**: Commit changes. Recommend TDD run on PhiloGraph ingestion using this new data. Further investigation needed for `create_epub2_with_guide`.
### [2025-05-09 09:09:18 PM] Task: Further Expand Synthetic EPUB Generation (Batch 2) &amp; Early Return
- **Trigger**: User Feedback requesting more EPUB examples and variations.
- **Context**: Continue expanding `synthetic_test_data/generate_epubs.py` based on `docs/qa/synthetic_data_requirements.md` and `docs/reports/epub_formatting_analysis_report.md`.
- **Action Taken**:
    - Re-read `docs/qa/synthetic_data_requirements.md` and `docs/reports/epub_formatting_analysis_report.md` for detailed EPUB formatting variations.
    - Implemented EPUB generation functions in `synthetic_test_data/generate_epubs.py` for:
        - NCX with `pageList` ([`create_epub_ncx_with_pagelist()`](synthetic_test_data/generate_epubs.py:91)).
        - Missing NCX (relying on NavDoc) ([`create_epub_missing_ncx()`](synthetic_test_data/generate_epubs.py:150)).
        - Full EPUB 3 NavDoc (ToC, Landmarks, PageList) ([`create_epub_navdoc_full()`](synthetic_test_data/generate_epubs.py:204)).
        - Taylor/Hegel style headers (h3 with classes/spans) ([`create_epub_taylor_hegel_headers()`](synthetic_test_data/generate_epubs.py:369)).
        - Sennet-style headers (h1/h2/h3 with specific classes) ([`create_epub_sennet_style_headers()`](synthetic_test_data/generate_epubs.py:1)).
        - Div-style headers ([`create_epub_div_style_headers()`](synthetic_test_data/generate_epubs.py:1)).
        - Pippin-style endnote references ([`create_epub_pippin_style_endnotes()`](synthetic_test_data/generate_epubs.py:1)).
        - Heidegger (German Existentialism) style endnote references ([`create_epub_heidegger_ge_style_endnotes()`](synthetic_test_data/generate_epubs.py:1)).
        - Heidegger (Metaphysics) style same-page footnote references and structure ([`create_epub_heidegger_metaphysics_style_footnotes()`](synthetic_test_data/generate_epubs.py:1)).
    - Updated `synthetic_test_data/generate_all_data.py` to call these new EPUB generation functions.
    - Successfully executed `python3 -m synthetic_test_data.generate_all_data` to generate all implemented synthetic files.
    - Updated `synthetic_test_data/README.md` to list all newly generated EPUB types.
    - Staged all new/modified scripts and newly generated EPUB files for commit.
- **Rationale**: Addressing user feedback to increase coverage of EPUB test cases with diverse formatting.
- **Outcome**: Script significantly enhanced with more EPUB generation functions for ToC, headers, and notes. New synthetic EPUB files generated. README updated. Changes committed (assumed complete by user feedback).
- **Follow-up**: User requested Early Return. Prepare `attempt_completion` and recommend delegation of remaining work.
### [2025-05-09 01:28:56 PM] Task: Refactor Synthetic Data Generation Scripts &amp; Add to .gitignore
- **Trigger**: User Feedback after previous script execution.
- **Context**: User requested modularization of the `generate_data.py` script and to add generated data to `.gitignore`.
- **Action Taken**:
    - Created `synthetic_test_data/common.py` and moved shared utilities (directory creation, EPUB helper functions, path constants) into it.
    - Created `synthetic_test_data/generate_epubs.py` and moved all EPUB generation functions into it, importing from `common.py`.
    - Created `synthetic_test_data/generate_pdfs.py` and moved PDF generation functions into it, importing from `common.py`.
    - Created `synthetic_test_data/generate_markdown.py` and moved Markdown generation functions into it, importing from `common.py`.
    - Created `synthetic_test_data/generate_all_data.py` as the new main runner script, which imports and calls functions from the specialized modules.
    - Updated the original `synthetic_test_data/generate_data.py` to be a placeholder script pointing to `generate_all_data.py`.
    - Updated `synthetic_test_data/README.md` to reflect the new modular script structure and how to run `generate_all_data.py`.
    - Created `synthetic_test_data/__init__.py` to make the directory a package, resolving relative import issues.
    - Successfully executed `python3 -m synthetic_test_data.generate_all_data` to generate all synthetic files using the new structure.
    - Added `synthetic_test_data/epub/`, `synthetic_test_data/pdf/`, and `synthetic_test_data/markdown/` to the `.gitignore` file.
    - Staged all new/modified scripts and the updated `.gitignore`. Committed changes.
- **Rationale**: Improving maintainability and extensibility of the synthetic data generation process as per user request. Ensuring generated data is not tracked by Git.
- **Outcome**: Synthetic data generation scripts refactored into a modular structure. Generated data directories added to `.gitignore`. All changes committed.
- **Follow-up**: Prepare `attempt_completion`.
### [2025-05-09 06:27:07] Task: Further Expand Synthetic Test Data Generation
- **Trigger**: User Feedback after previous `attempt_completion` was interrupted.
- **Context**: User requested more EPUB examples and greater variation to cover test cases from `docs/qa/synthetic_data_requirements.md` and `docs/reports/epub_formatting_analysis_report.md`.
- **Action Taken**:
    - Re-read `docs/qa/synthetic_data_requirements.md` and `docs/reports/epub_formatting_analysis_report.md`.
    - Identified next EPUB scenarios: styled `<p>` tag headers, headers with edition markers, same-page footnotes, separate file endnotes, minimal metadata, poetry formatting.
    - Modified `_create_epub_book` helper in `synthetic_test_data/generate_data.py` to allow more control over default and custom metadata.
    - Implemented `create_epub_p_tag_headers()` for EPUBs with styled paragraph headers.
    - Implemented `create_epub_headers_with_edition_markers()` for EPUBs with embedded edition markers.
    - Implemented `create_epub_same_page_footnotes()` for EPUBs with same-page hyperlinked footnotes.
    - Implemented `create_epub_endnotes_separate_file()` for EPUBs with hyperlinked endnotes in a separate file.
    - Implemented `create_epub_minimal_metadata()` for EPUBs with sparse metadata.
    - Implemented `create_epub_poetry()` for EPUBs with poetry formatting.
    - Encountered and resolved issues with `apply_diff` and `write_to_file` not correctly updating the main execution block of the script. Used `search_and_replace` as a workaround to ensure all new generation functions were called.
    - Successfully executed `python3 synthetic_test_data/generate_data.py` to generate all implemented file types.
    - Updated `synthetic_test_data/README.md` to list all newly generated EPUB types.
    - Staged all new/modified files (`generate_data.py`, `README.md`, and all generated `.epub` files) and committed them to the `feat/synthetic-test-data` branch.
- **Rationale**: Addressing user feedback to increase coverage of EPUB test cases.
- **Outcome**: Script significantly enhanced with more EPUB generation functions, new synthetic EPUB files generated, README updated, all changes committed.
- **Follow-up**: Prepare `attempt_completion`.
### [2025-05-09 05:51:07] Task: Expand Synthetic Test Data Generation
- **Trigger**: User Task received [Ref: User Task 2025-05-09 05:38:58 AM]
- **Context**: Expand `synthetic_test_data/generate_data.py` to cover more complex EPUB, PDF, and Markdown scenarios based on `docs/qa/synthetic_data_requirements.md`.
- **Action Taken**:
    - Ensured working on `feat/synthetic-test-data` branch.
    - Read `docs/qa/synthetic_data_requirements.md` and `synthetic_test_data/generate_data.py`.
    - Added helper functions (`_create_epub_book`, `_add_epub_chapters`, `_write_epub_file`) to `generate_data.py`.
    - Added `create_epub_ncx_nested()` for EPUBs with 3-level nested NCX ToC.
    - Added `create_epub_html_toc_linked()` for EPUBs with a separate HTML ToC.
    - Added `reportlab` to `requirements.txt`.
    - Added `create_pdf_text_single_column()` for basic single-column text PDF generation.
    - Added `create_md_extended_elements()` for Markdown with tables, footnotes, task lists, code blocks, and TOML frontmatter.
    - Updated YAML frontmatter in `create_md_basic_elements()` to include a custom field.
    - Executed `pip3 install -r requirements.txt` to install `reportlab`.
    - Corrected a `TypeError` in `create_epub_ncx_nested` related to `ebooklib.epub.Link` children argument.
    - Executed `python3 synthetic_test_data/generate_data.py` to generate new files.
    - Updated `synthetic_test_data/README.md` to reflect new script capabilities, dependencies, and generated files.
    - Committed all changes (script, README, requirements, new synthetic files) to `feat/synthetic-test-data` branch.
- **Rationale**: Fulfilling task requirements to expand synthetic data generation capabilities.
- **Outcome**: Script enhanced, new synthetic files generated, README updated, changes committed.
- **Follow-up**: Prepare `attempt_completion`.

### [2025-05-09 05:38:00] Task: Generate Synthetic Test Data (Initial)
- **Trigger**: Task received from user/SPARC [Ref: User Task 2025-05-09 05:33:07 AM, Spec-Pseudocode Completion Summary 2025-05-09 05:32:50 AM].
- **Context**: Need for synthetic EPUB, PDF, and Markdown files to test PhiloGraph ingestion pipeline, based on requirements in `docs/qa/synthetic_data_requirements.md`.
- **Action Taken**:
    - Created and switched to `feat/synthetic-test-data` branch from `feature/relationship-service`.
    - Reviewed `docs/qa/synthetic_data_requirements.md`.
    - Created directory structure `./synthetic_test_data/` and subdirectories.
    - Wrote `synthetic_test_data/generate_data.py` script using `ebooklib` to create an initial simple EPUB (`ncx_simple.epub`) and a basic Markdown file (`all_basic_elements.md`).
    - Successfully executed the script after installing dependencies (`pip3 install -r requirements.txt`).
    - Created `synthetic_test_data/README.md` explaining the script and data.
- **Rationale**: Fulfilling the first steps of the task to generate synthetic test data. The script provides a foundation for generating more complex files.
- **Outcome**: Initial directory structure, generation script, README, and two sample synthetic files created.
- **Follow-up**: Commit files to the new branch. Prepare `attempt_completion` message. Recommend TDD run (though not directly applicable to this data generation task itself, it's a general good practice).
### [2025-05-02 22:21:49] Fix: Remediate Acquisition Service Security Findings
- **Trigger**: Task received to address Medium severity security findings [Ref: Security Review 2025-05-02 22:20:05].
- **Context**: Security review identified unsanitized data passed to MCP download tool (SR-ACQ-001) and potential DoS via resource exhaustion due to lack of rate limiting (SR-ACQ-002) in `src/philograph/acquisition/service.py`.
- **Action Taken**:
    - Added imports for `time`, `collections.deque`, `typing.Set`.
    - Implemented `_validate_book_details` helper function with `EXPECTED_BOOK_KEYS` and `REQUIRED_BOOK_KEYS` sets. This function checks dictionary type, unexpected keys, missing required keys, and basic type validation for `md5` and `download_url`. Added call to this validator in `confirm_and_trigger_download` before the MCP call (SR-ACQ-001).
    - Added global `deque` variables (`_search_request_timestamps`, `_download_request_timestamps`) and constants for rate limit window/max requests.
    - Implemented rate limiting checks using `time.time()` and the deques at the beginning of `start_acquisition_search` and `confirm_and_trigger_download` (SR-ACQ-002).
- **Rationale**: Addressing specific security vulnerabilities identified in the review to improve robustness and security posture. Input validation prevents potential injection attacks via MCP arguments. Rate limiting mitigates potential DoS attacks.
- **Outcome**: Security findings SR-ACQ-001 and SR-ACQ-002 addressed in `src/philograph/acquisition/service.py`.
- **Follow-up**: Update Memory Bank. Perform pre-completion checks. Recommend TDD run to verify fixes and check for regressions.
### [2025-05-01 15:46:53] Fix: Correct Syntax Errors in Search Service
- **Trigger**: Task handover from SPARC to fix syntax errors introduced during Debug session [Ref: Debug Feedback 2025-05-01 15:43:00].
- **Context**: Syntax errors (indentation, try/except structure) around line 40 in `src/philograph/search/service.py` prevented further debugging of [Ref: Issue-ID: CLI-API-500-ERRORS].
- **Action Taken**:
    - Added missing `json` and `psycopg` imports.
    - Used `apply_diff` to restructure the `try...except` block in `get_query_embedding`:
        - Removed duplicate `response.json()` call.
        - Moved logging statements inside the main `try` block before `response.json()`.
        - Handled `json.JSONDecodeError` specifically within the `try` block.
        - Corrected indentation of subsequent code and `except` blocks.
        - Added `exc_info=True` to logger calls in except blocks for better debugging.
        - Refined response format validation check (`isinstance(response_data['data'], list)`).
- **Rationale**: Correcting syntax errors introduced by previous `insert_content` operation and improving error handling/logging structure.
- **Outcome**: Syntax errors in `src/philograph/search/service.py` resolved. File parses correctly.
- **Follow-up**: Update MB, commit changes, recommend TDD run for verification and continued debugging.
### [2025-04-29 04:18:51] Intervention: Fix Syntax Errors after TDD Early Return
- **Trigger**: Task handover from TDD mode due to Early Return and persistent syntax errors [Ref: TDD Feedback 2025-04-29 04:17:00].
- **Context**: Syntax errors (stray parenthesis, duplicate line) around line 597 in `tests/cli/test_main.py` introduced by failed tool use (`insert_content`/`apply_diff`) during TDD.
- **Action Taken**: Used `apply_diff` to remove the erroneous lines 597 and 598.
- **Rationale**: Direct removal of identified incorrect lines.
- **Outcome**: Syntax errors corrected. File requires verification.
- **Follow-up**: Recommend `pytest --collect-only` verification. Update Memory Bank.
