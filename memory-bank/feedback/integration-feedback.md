### [2025-05-05 20:43:18] - Integration - Task Completion
**Source:** Integration Task (Resume `feature/relationship-service` integration) [Ref: Task 2025-05-05 20:40:31]
**Issue:** None. Task completed successfully.
**Actions Taken:**
1.  Checked out `feature/relationship-service` and pulled latest changes.
2.  Attempted merge of `docs/readme-fixes` (Already up to date).
3.  Attempted merge of `fix/devops-holistic-review` (Already up to date).
4.  Attempted merge of `feat/cli-api-alignment` (Already up to date).
5.  Merged `fix/text-processing-todos` (Fast-forward).
6.  Ran `pytest` suite (`docker-compose exec philograph-backend pytest`). Result: 357 passed, 8 skipped.
**Outcome:** All specified branches successfully integrated into `feature/relationship-service`. Test suite passes with the expected 8 skips (7 CLI Typer issue, 1 unrelated).
**Follow-up:** Task complete. Preparing `attempt_completion`.
### [2025-05-05 14:07:40] - Integration - Typer CLI Test Failures & Delegation
**Source:** Integration Task (Resume `feature/relationship-service` integration)
**Issue:** After merging `docs/readme-fixes` and `fix/devops-holistic-review` into `feature/relationship-service`, and confirming `feat/cli-api-alignment` was already merged, the 7 tests previously skipped in `tests/cli/test_cli_acquire.py` continued to fail after removing the skip markers. The failures relate to Typer's `CliRunner` misinterpreting arguments/options for nested subcommands (`acquire discover --yes`, `acquire confirm`), leading to incorrect exit codes and assertion errors (e.g., expecting prompts that aren't called, incorrect error messages).
**Actions Taken:**
1.  Removed `@pytest.mark.skip` decorators from the 7 failing tests.
2.  Attempt 1: Corrected `typer.Option` definitions in `acquire_discover` and `acquire_confirm` functions in `src/philograph/cli/main.py`. Tests still failed.
3.  Attempt 2: Removed `context_settings={"ignore_unknown_options": True}` from the `acquire_app` Typer instance definition. Tests still failed.
4.  Stashed the ineffective changes to `src/philograph/cli/main.py`.
**Rationale for Delegation:** Two direct attempts to fix the Typer command definitions failed. The issue appears complex, likely related to `CliRunner`'s interaction with nested Typer apps, aligning with the original reason for skipping ("persistent Typer subcommand interference issue"). Following the "Three Strikes" rule, debugging this specific issue is delegated.
**Outcome:** Integration paused pending resolution of test failures.
**Follow-up:** Delegating to `debug` mode via `new_task` to investigate and fix the 7 failing tests in `tests/cli/test_cli_acquire.py`.
### [2025-05-05 08:05:28] - Integration - Early Return (Context Limit)
- **Trigger:** User instruction due to high context (63%).
- **Task:** Integrate feature branches into `feature/relationship-service`.
- **Progress:** Merged `refactor/holistic-review-fixes`. Identified and attempted fixes for resulting test failures in `tests/cli/test_cli_acquire.py` due to CLI refactoring (`acquire` -> `acquire discover`/`acquire confirm`). Updated `src/philograph/cli/main.py` to use subcommands. Updated `tests/cli/test_cli_acquire.py` multiple times to correct assertions and command invocations.
- **Blocker:** Persistent test failures (8) in `tests/cli/test_cli_acquire.py` related to command invocation (exit code 2) and output assertions. Context limit prevents further effective debugging.
- **Analysis:** The merge correctly updated tests but not the source CLI implementation initially. Subsequent fixes to source and tests still result in failures, likely due to subtle issues in Typer argument parsing/handling or test setup for the new subcommands. The `acquire confirm` command signature and invocation in tests seem particularly problematic.
- **Context %:** 63%
- **Recommendations:** Delegate task continuation via `new_task` to a fresh instance. Focus on resolving the remaining 8 failures in `tests/cli/test_cli_acquire.py` before proceeding with further merges. Specifically investigate the `acquire confirm` command signature and test invocation, and the argument/output handling in `acquire discover`.
