# Architect Feedback
<!-- Entries below should be added reverse chronologically (newest first) -->

### [2025-04-28 03:35:37] - User Feedback on Tier 0 Architecture Attempt 3
*   **Trigger:** User denied `attempt_completion` after incorporating `zlibrary-mcp` integration.
*   **Context:** Attempted completion summarizing ADR creation and document updates for embedding dimension and `zlibrary-mcp`.
*   **Feedback:** "MORE DETAIL" - The summary was not sufficiently detailed.
*   **Action:** Will re-craft the completion summary to provide more explanation of the architectural decisions, their implications, and the final state.
*   **Rationale:** Address user request for a more comprehensive overview of the completed work.
*   **Outcome:** Task continuation to provide a detailed completion summary.
*   **Follow-up:** Craft detailed summary, attempt completion again.

### [2025-04-28 03:31:35] - Task Resumption & New Requirement: zlibrary-mcp Integration
*   **Trigger:** Task resumption after interruption. User provided updated `project-specifications.md` summary (v2.3) and `zlibrary-mcp` README.
*   **Context:** Previous task involved creating Tier 0 architecture docs and ADRs, including embedding dimensionality decisions.
*   **New Requirement:** Integrate the `zlibrary-mcp` server for text acquisition into the Tier 0 architecture documents based on the updated spec and README.
*   **Action:** Will create ADR 008 for this decision and update `docs/architecture/tier0_mvp_architecture.md`, `memory-bank/globalContext.md`, `memory-bank/mode-specific/architect.md`, and `memory-bank/activeContext.md`.
*   **Rationale:** Incorporate the specified external MCP server integration into the architecture design.
*   **Outcome:** Task continuation to update architectural documents.
*   **Follow-up:** Create ADR 008, update existing documents, update memory bank, attempt completion.

### [2025-04-28 01:42:23] - User Feedback on Tier 0 Architecture Attempt 2
*   **Trigger:** User denied `attempt_completion` after ADR creation and document updates.
*   **Context:** Attempted completion after creating ADRs and updating docs with embedding model/dimension.
*   **Feedback:** Requires more detail on a potential testing procedure for empirically validating the optimal embedding dimensionality (768 vs 1024).
*   **Action:** Will draft a testing procedure section and add it to the relevant ADR (004).
*   **Rationale:** Provide necessary detail on validation steps as requested by the user.
*   **Outcome:** Task continuation to add testing procedure.
*   **Follow-up:** Draft testing procedure, update ADR 004, update memory bank, attempt completion again.

### [2025-04-27 23:59:06] - User Feedback on Research Prompt Tool Use
*   **Trigger:** User denied `use_mcp_tool` attempt for `vectorize` server's `deep-research` tool.
*   **Context:** Attempting to generate research prompt for embedding dimensionality via MCP tool.
*   **Feedback:** User clarified that the `vectorize` tool is not appropriate; I should provide the research prompt text directly for the user to submit to Gemini Deep Research manually.
*   **Action:** Will provide the research prompt text instead of using the tool.
*   **Rationale:** Follow user clarification on how to handle research prompt generation.
*   **Outcome:** Task continuation to provide prompt text.
*   **Follow-up:** Provide research prompt text.

### [2025-04-27 23:53:18] - User Feedback on Tier 0 Architecture Attempt
*   **Trigger:** User denied `attempt_completion` after creation of `docs/architecture/tier0_mvp_architecture.md`.
*   **Context:** Initial Tier 0 architecture document created based on spec v2.3. Memory Bank updated.
*   **Feedback:**
    1.  Missing Architecture Decision Records (ADRs) for key decisions.
    2.  Architecture document and Memory Bank did not specify the chosen Vertex AI embedding model (`text-embedding-large-exp-03-07`).
    3.  Decision on embedding dimensionality is pending research; requires a research prompt for Gemini Deep Research.
*   **Action:** Will create ADRs, update documents with the specific embedding model, and generate the research prompt for dimensionality.
*   **Rationale:** Address user feedback to ensure completeness and accuracy of architectural documentation and decisions.
*   **Outcome:** Task continuation to incorporate feedback.
*   **Follow-up:** Create ADRs, update docs, generate research prompt.
