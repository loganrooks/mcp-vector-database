- **Trigger:** User feedback requesting analysis of migration paths and scalability between deployment tiers (2025-04-27 17:47:55).
- **Context:** After presenting the updated report reflecting local laptop constraints, the user asked for an evaluation of how easily one could migrate from Tier 0 options to Tier 1, and Tier 1 to Tier 2, considering immediate deployability vs. future migration effort.
- **Action:** Plan to add a new section ("Migration Paths and Scalability Analysis") to `docs/reports/philograph_synthesis_and_recommendations.md` evaluating the trade-offs of starting with different Tier 0 databases (ArangoDB, Postgres, SQLite) regarding ease of setup vs. migration effort to cloud tiers.
- **Rationale:** Address user concern about future scalability and migration effort when choosing an initial local deployment strategy.
- **Outcome:** Pending addition of the new section to the report.
- **Follow-up:** Add the analysis section to the report and update relevant MB entries.
- **Trigger:** User query regarding ArangoDB cost for local pilot (2025-04-27 17:34:18).
- **Context:** Previous report synthesis discussed cloud costs (ArangoDB Oasis) alongside local options, causing confusion about local costs. User specified a need for free or max $10/month local solution.
- **Action:** Clarified that ArangoDB Community Edition, PostgreSQL+pgvector, and SQLite+vss are all free for local deployment via Docker/file. Updated synthesis report (`docs/reports/philograph_synthesis_and_recommendations.md`) Tier 0 description and summary table to explicitly state $0 software cost for local options and reflect CPU/RAM constraints of the specified laptop hardware (i7-1260P, 16GB RAM, Integrated Graphics).
- **Rationale:** Ensure recommendations align with user's explicit cost constraints for the local pilot scenario.
- **Outcome:** Report updated to accurately reflect free local database options and hardware-specific local deployment recommendations.
- **Follow-up:** None required.
# Specification Writer Feedback Log

## 2025-04-04 12:59:39 - Initial Specification Review Feedback
- **Source:** User input comparing initial `docs/project-specifications.md` against `docs/project_idea.md`.
- **Issue:** The initial specification, while strong, lacked detail in several areas identified in the project idea and needed more robust technical planning for expandability. Specific gaps included: PDF page number handling, footnote processing, Calibre/Quercus/Social Network integration details, bulk document processing, local file organization, and explicit strategies for API-first design, plugins, DB versioning, component separation, eventing, feature flags, and testing extensions.
- **Action:** Rewrote `docs/project-specifications.md` to incorporate all feedback points, enhancing detail and technical strategy.

## 2025-04-04 12:59:39 - Memory Bank Initialization Request
- **Source:** User feedback after specification rewrite completion.
- **Issue:** User requested initialization of the Memory Bank.
- **Action:** Created initial Memory Bank files (`activeContext.md`, `globalContext.md`, `mode-specific/spec-pseudocode.md`, `feedback/spec-pseudocode-feedback.md`) populated with context from the completed specification task.
