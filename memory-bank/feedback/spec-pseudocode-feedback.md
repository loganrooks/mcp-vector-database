# Specification Writer Feedback Log

## 2025-04-04 12:59:39 - Initial Specification Review Feedback
- **Source:** User input comparing initial `docs/project-specifications.md` against `docs/project_idea.md`.
- **Issue:** The initial specification, while strong, lacked detail in several areas identified in the project idea and needed more robust technical planning for expandability. Specific gaps included: PDF page number handling, footnote processing, Calibre/Quercus/Social Network integration details, bulk document processing, local file organization, and explicit strategies for API-first design, plugins, DB versioning, component separation, eventing, feature flags, and testing extensions.
- **Action:** Rewrote `docs/project-specifications.md` to incorporate all feedback points, enhancing detail and technical strategy.

## 2025-04-04 12:59:39 - Memory Bank Initialization Request
- **Source:** User feedback after specification rewrite completion.
- **Issue:** User requested initialization of the Memory Bank.
- **Action:** Created initial Memory Bank files (`activeContext.md`, `globalContext.md`, `mode-specific/spec-pseudocode.md`, `feedback/spec-pseudocode-feedback.md`) populated with context from the completed specification task.
