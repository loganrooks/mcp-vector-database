### [2025-05-09 05:11:05] - User Intervention: Test Data Strategy Shift
- **Trigger:** User feedback during E2E test plan finalization.
- **Context:** Preparing for E2E test execution of PhiloGraph Tier 0 MVP. Issues encountered with downloading real-world sample files.
- **Action Taken (User Directive):** User proposed to halt current E2E testing approach and instead generate synthetic test data (EPUB, PDF, Markdown) based on `docs/reports/epub_formatting_analysis_report.md` to cover a wide range of formatting variations.
- **Rationale (User):** To create more robust and targeted test assets for both E2E and unit testing, ensuring the system can handle diverse inputs for preprocessing, chunking, and metadata/relationship extraction.
- **Outcome:** Current E2E testing task deferred. A new task for synthetic test data generation will be recommended to the Orchestrator. The E2E test plan (`docs/qa/tier0_e2e_plan_20250506.md`) will require updates once synthetic data is available.
- **Follow-up:** Use `attempt_completion` to summarize this and suggest delegation of the new data generation task.
