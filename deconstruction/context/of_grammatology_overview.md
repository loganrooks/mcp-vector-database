# A Detailed Overview of Derrida's Philosophy in *Of Grammatology*

Jacques Derrida's *Of Grammatology* (1967), alongside *Speech and Phenomena* and *Writing and Difference* published the same year, represents a pivotal moment in 20th-century thought, launching the critical practice known as deconstruction. The book undertakes a radical critique of the Western philosophical and linguistic tradition, arguing that it is fundamentally shaped by what Derrida terms **logocentrism** and **phonocentrism**—a deep-seated bias prioritizing speech (the *phonè*) over writing (the *grammè*) based on a flawed "metaphysics of presence." Derrida aims to dismantle this hierarchy by revealing the primacy of a generalized concept of "writing"—**archi-writing**—understood as the structure of **trace** and **différance**, which underlies and makes possible both speech and conventional writing.

## 1. Logocentrism, Phonocentrism, and the Metaphysics of Presence

*   **Logocentrism:** Derrida argues that the entire history of Western metaphysics, from Plato through Aristotle, Descartes, Rousseau, Hegel, Husserl, and even aspects of Heidegger, is dominated by **logocentrism**. This is the orientation toward a *logos*—understood variously as reason, divine word, truth, meaning, substance, or self-present consciousness—as the origin and end-point of all reality and knowledge. This logos is conceived as a point of full, self-sufficient **presence** (lines 3, 12-13, 105-6, 268, 345-46). Truth, in this tradition, is determined as presence—whether as the presence of the thing to sight (*eidos*), presence as substance (*ousia*), temporal presence as the now (*stigmè*, *nun*), or the self-presence of consciousness (*cogito*) (lines 12-13, 23-24).
*   **Phonocentrism:** This is the specific manifestation of logocentrism within the theory of language. It grants an absolute privilege to the **voice** (*phonè*) because the experience of **hearing-oneself-speak** (*s'entendre-parler*) seems to offer immediate, transparent self-presence. The voice appears as an "ideal" signifier, seemingly internal, non-worldly, non-empirical, directly uniting thought/meaning (the signified) with its expression (the signifier) without exterior mediation (lines xc-xci, 7-8, 11-13, 32-33, 106, 180, 182, 261-62). This perceived proximity of voice to sense, soul, and being grounds the traditional view of speech as primary, living, and natural.
*   **Debasement of Writing:** Consequently, writing in the conventional sense (graphic inscription) is relegated to a secondary, derivative, and merely technical role. It is seen as an external representation, an "image" or "clothing" for speech, potentially dangerous, artificial, and even pathological—a "fall" from the living presence of the logos (lines xiii-xvii, 32-47, 157, 321). Saussure, despite his advances, inherits this prejudice, defining writing as existing "for the sole purpose of representing" speech and being "unrelated to its inner system" (lines 32-33, 36-37). Rousseau similarly condemns written signs as dead letters compared to the living voice inscribed by God or nature in the heart (lines 17-18, 157). Derrida argues this phonocentrism is an ethnocentric bias tied to the history and structure of phonetic-alphabetic writing in the West (lines 3, 118-19, 130, 133-34, 353).

## 2. The Critique of Presence and Origin

*   Derrida's core move is to deconstruct this "metaphysics of presence." He argues that pure, unmediated presence is a myth, an effect rather than a foundation. Presence is always already divided, deferred, mediated by the trace of absence and difference. The experience of self-presence in speech, for example, is shown (following Husserl's analyses but turning them against Husserl's conclusions) to be constituted by temporalization (retention and protention) and the necessary possibility of repetition, which introduces non-presence into the heart of the present (lines lxxiv, 12-13, 23-24, 106-7, 180, 272, 286-87, 337-38, 344-45).
*   This critique extends to the concept of **origin** (*arche*). An absolute, simple origin, conceived as a point of pure presence before any fall or mediation, is shown to be impossible. Any origin is already marked by the trace of what it is not; it is constituted retroactively through a process of differentiation and supplementation. The "origin of the origin" is the trace itself, a non-origin (lines x-xi, xviii, xxxvi-xxxvii, 66, 100, 106-7, 267-69, 341). The desire for the origin is an effect of the structure of supplementarity (lines 177, 267-69).

## 3. The Sign, Signifier, and Signified Revisited

*   Derrida engages closely with Saussure's linguistics. He values Saussure's insights into the **differential** nature of the sign (value arises from differences *between* signs, not positive qualities) and its **arbitrary** nature (no natural link between signifier and signified) (lines xi-xii, 35, 47-48, 51, 57, 382n8). These insights, Derrida notes, already challenge the substantialist view of language and the privilege of the phonic substance (lines 57-58).
*   However, Derrida argues that Saussure remains trapped within logocentrism by maintaining the binary opposition between **signifier** and **signified**, even as two sides of the same coin. This distinction still presupposes a signified (meaning, concept) that is thinkable, present to consciousness, prior to or outside the play of signifiers (lines 13-15, 33-34, 48, 79).
*   Deconstruction reveals that the signified is always already in the position of a signifier, caught in an endless chain of referrals where each sign points only to another sign. There is no ultimate meaning or presence—no **transcendental signified**—outside this play (lines xxxiv-xxxv, 7, 13-15, 21, 53-54, 79, 380n9). Peirce's notion of the infinite interpretant is cited as pointing in a similar direction (lines 53-54). This infinite substitution undermines the classical concept of the sign itself (lines 11, 14-15, 79).

## 4. Archi-Writing, Trace, and Spacing

*   To think the possibility of signification beyond the logocentric concept of the sign, Derrida introduces **archi-writing** (arche-writing). This is not writing in the conventional sense but a generalized "writing" that signifies the **trace** as the fundamental structure of possibility for *all* signification, including speech.
*   The **trace** is the core concept. It is *not* an empirical mark left behind by a past presence. It is the irreducible movement of **differance** itself, the marking of the other within the same, the non-presence that constitutes presence, the spacing that allows differences to appear. It is the "absolute origin of sense in general," which means there is no absolute origin (lines x-xi, xxxiv, xxxvi-xxxvii, lix-lx, lxvi, lxxviii, xci-xcii, 61, 65-68, 70, 75-77, 91, 100-101, 118, 135, 138, 181-82, 341-42, 357). It is neither sensible nor intelligible, neither present nor absent.
*   Archi-writing is this structure of the trace, this fundamental **spacing** (the becoming-space of time and the becoming-time of space) that articulates differences and makes any system (linguistic, psychic, biological) possible (lines xiv, 43, 64, 71-77, 92-93, 97, 217-18, 220-21, 248-49, 274, 285-86, 299, 350, 362). It is the condition for the possibility of the sign itself.

## 5. Différance

*   **Différance** is Derrida's neologism for the movement of the trace. Spelled with an 'a' (inaudible in French, highlighting the role of writing), it combines two meanings:
    *   To **differ**: To be unlike, distinct; the production of difference, spacing, articulation.
    *   To **defer**: To postpone, delay, put off; temporalization, the detour, the reserve.
*   Différance is thus the spatio-temporal movement that produces differences, constitutes presence through delay and detour, and makes signification possible. It is not a concept, an entity, or an origin, but the non-present, non-originary play that precedes and makes possible all ontological determinations and binary oppositions (sensible/intelligible, presence/absence, speech/writing, nature/culture, etc.) (lines xi, xiv, xxxiv, xlviii, lxiv-lxvi, xciii-xciv, 25, 67-68, 73, 75-77, 101, 155-56, 167, 170-71, 181, 199, 202-3, 266-68, 274, 282-83, 305, 341-42, 356-57). It is the economy of death at work within life (lines lxiii, 155-56).

## 6. The Logic of the Supplement

*   Derrida's reading of Rousseau focuses on the term **supplement** to demonstrate the workings of differance and the instability of presence.
*   The supplement embodies a paradoxical logic:
    *   It **adds** itself to something presumed to be already complete and self-sufficient (like art to nature, writing to speech). It represents a surplus, an enrichment.
    *   Simultaneously, it **replaces** something, insinuating itself into the place of an original lack or deficiency. It compensates for a failing in that which it supplements. It is a substitute, a proxy (lines 157-58).
*   The supplement is always **exterior** to what it supplements, yet this exteriority is what constitutes the interiority of the original term. Nature needs culture's supplement, speech needs writing's, presence needs representation's, because the "original" was never purely present or self-sufficient. It always already carried the trace of the lack that called for the supplement (lines 158-62, 181, 233-34, 246, 266-68, 280-83, 305-6, 321, 324-25, 341-42).
*   This leads to the idea of the **supplement at the origin**: the origin itself is constituted by/as a supplement, meaning there is no simple, pure origin. Supplementarity operates in an **infinite chain**, where each supplement refers only to another supplement, endlessly deferring the presence of the "thing itself" (lines 166-71, 177, 341).
*   The supplement is **dangerous** because it threatens the illusion of pure presence and self-identity, introducing mediation, artifice, and the possibility of perversion (like masturbation supplementing "natural" sex, or writing corrupting "living" speech). Yet it is also **necessary** and even beneficial, providing protection, compensation, and the very possibility of experience, language, and society (lines 157, 162-65, 168-69, 172-73, 216, 221, 233-34, 283, 290, 305, 336, 354-55). Its logic is "inconceivable to reason" within the framework of classical ontology (lines 163, 168, 282-83).

## 7. Deconstruction as Reading Practice

*   *Of Grammatology* is not just theory; it performs deconstruction. Deconstructive reading involves:
    *   **Inhabiting the text:** Working from within the logic and concepts of the text being read (lines xx, 25, 171-72).
    *   **Identifying the dominant hierarchy:** Recognizing the binary oppositions (speech/writing, nature/culture, presence/absence) and the privilege accorded to one term (lines lxxx, c, 110, 113, 156).
    *   **Focusing on the marginal term:** Paying close attention to the supposedly secondary or derivative term (writing, supplement, trace, metaphor) (lines lxx, xcviii-xcix, 171-72).
    *   **Locating the "blind spot" or "undecidable":** Finding the point where the text's logic breaks down, contradicts itself, or where the marginal term reveals its constitutive role, often through the play of a word like "supplement" or "pharmakon" (lines lxx, xcviii-xcix, 171-72, 177-78).
    *   **Displacing the hierarchy:** Showing how the "inferior" term is actually the condition of possibility for the "superior" one, thus destabilizing the opposition without simply reversing it (lines lxxx, c).
    *   **Revealing textuality:** Demonstrating that the text is always already a "fabric" (textile) woven from traces, differences, and supplements, without a simple origin or fully present meaning (lines 163, 172-78, 355-56).

## Significance and Interrelations

All these concepts converge on the central argument: the Western tradition's logocentric focus on presence and speech represses the more fundamental role of archi-writing (trace, differance, supplementarity) which constitutes all experience and signification. Speech is a form of writing; presence is an effect of differance; nature is always already supplemented by culture; the origin is structured like a trace. Deconstruction, as demonstrated through the reading of Rousseau and others, is the method for revealing this underlying structure. *Of Grammatology* seeks not just to critique metaphysics but to open a way of thinking "beyond the closure" (lines 4-5, 101, 176), acknowledging the irreducible play of difference and the absence of absolute foundations, origins, or presence. It calls for a rethinking of language, history, subjectivity, and the very nature of philosophical inquiry itself.
